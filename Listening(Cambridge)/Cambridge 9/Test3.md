XXX Holidays, can I help you?

Yes, I hope so, I have a friend who's just come back for Corfu and she's recommended some apartments in Arilas. She thought they might be on new list.

Let me see. Can you give me the names?

Yes, the First's Rose Garden Apartment. I'd like to go with another friend in the last week of October.

Well, we got a lovely <u>studio flat</u> available at that time. I'm sure you'd enjoy the entertainment program there too, with greek dancing in the restaurant

And the cost of each of us?

219 pounds

That sounds very reasonable. I'm just <u>jotting</u> down some notes. Now the second one she mentioned was called Blue Bay. 

Blue Bay, yes, in fact, that's very popular, and it has some special features.

Really?

The main attraction is the large swimming pool with salt water.

Emm, much healthier, I understand.

Right, and it isn't far from the beach either, only 300 meters, and only around a half kilometer to some shops. So, you don't have to be too <u>energetic</u>.

Is it much more expensive than the first one?

Let me just check. I think at the time you want to go is around 260 pounds, no, 275 pounds to be exact.

Right, I've got that. Not there're just 2 more apartments to ask about. I can't read my own writing. Something to do with sun.. Sunshine, is it?

I think you meant the Sunshade apartments. They're on a mountainside.

Any special features?

Yes, each room has its own sun terrace. And there're shared barbecue facilities.

Sounds lovely.

 Yes, it is rather well-equipped. It also provides water sports, it has its own beach. There're facilities for water skiing.

Any XXX? My friend's quite keen.

Not at the hotel. But I'm sure you find'll some in Arilas. There's also satellite TV in apartments.

And how mush is that one?

490 pounds with two sharing.

You meaning 245 pounds each?

I'm afraid not, each person have to pay that amount and they must at least two in an apartment.

I don't think it will be in our budget, unfortunately. And last one souds a bit expensive too, the Grand?

Actually, It's quite reasonable.

For the second in our series about locally-run businesses, we meet Simon Winridge, co-founder of the hugely successful Winridge Forest Railway Park, welcome Simon.

Now, perhaps you can begin by telling us a little bit about how it all started.

Well, during 1970, my <u>wife,</u> <u>Liz and</u> I had just acquired 8 acres of ship farming land. And we decide to settle down and have children. Pretty soon, we have a daughter, Salar and a son, Duncan. The place was wonderful for the kids, they particularly love trains, and gradually built up a<u>n en</u>ormous network of miniature railway track. And I began to develop larger-scale models of locomotives, but we didn't think anything more of it until I went on a trip to a theme park near Berninham and decide we could do a much better job. So we set up a small one ourselves based on the miniature railway. And we open to the public for ... just a month that year, 1984, in July, our driest month. Because our children said they didn't want our guests to have miserable wet visits. I dealt with the park business and <u>Liz</u> carry on with farm work. It soon became clear that we we<u>r</u><u>e onto</u> a winner. We began to <u>extend the</u> railway track and <u>lay</u> i<u>t among</u> more interesting landscape by planting trees, which <u>in turn</u> to attracted more wildlife. And by making cuttings through the rock. Nowadays, We're open all yea<u>r around</u>, and we're pleased to say that the Windridge is one of the most popular visitor attractions in the area, with 50 thousand visitors a year. A millio<u>n a</u>nd a half people have been through doors since we opened.

All these visitors mean we've had to expend our operation, and it's now a truly family concern. I'm near to retirement age, so I only concern myself with looking after the mechanical side of things, keeping the trains going. Liz now devotes all her energies to recruiting and supporting the large <u>squadron</u> of workers which keep the place running smoothly. We're really pleased that after some years away teaching. Salar has now return to the park and make sure the visitor<u>s are</u> kept fe<u>d an</u>~~d~~ watered which keeps her pretty busy as you can imagine. Our son, Duncan has been a <u>stalwart o</u>f the park for the last 10 years, taking over fro~~m~~ me in the area of construction. And, I'll say a little bit more about that in the moment, and his wife, Judy has also joined the team in charge of retail. That's becoming a tremendous **growth** area fo<u>r us</u>. A lot of people want to buy souvenirs. 

So have you finished your development of the site for the moment? 

Not at all. We're consistently looking for ways to **off~~er~~** more to our visitors. The railway remains the central feature. And there's now 1.2 kilometers of the lined laid, but we'd like to lay more. Because the geology of the area, ~~our~~ greatest problem is digging tunnels, but we're gradually overcoming that. We're also very pleased with the new **inst~~al~~lation** of the go-kart arena which i<u>s a</u> hundre<u>d an</u>~~d~~ twenty square meters in area. Again, the problem is the geology. We ha~~d~~ to level the **moun~~d~~**<u>s on</u> the track for safety reasons. We wante~~d~~ to enable 5 to 12 year olds to use the go-kart. An<u>d the</u> mai<u>n a</u>ttraction here is the Formula 1 Kart. We've known **fights** to break out over who get it. And then finally to o~~ur~~ most recent development which is the landscape...
