Nowadays, more and more governments **take the economic improvement as their most important goal,** it is reasonable and genuinely helps a lot. But some people think that the other types of improvement in our society is equivalent necessary likewise, for instance, human **health**, environment, entertainment and so on. **Whether nations suppose to prioritize the economy or keep a balance in all types of improvement depends on how degree their economy has developed.**

In terms of the aim to the economy, It is certainly a important part of a country. The other types of progress couldn't practice well if a country's economy doesn't strong enough, it is a basis of anything else. Besides, in certain case, the advance of economy could help the other aspects of society. For instance, academy, healthy, and environment is **lacking** in Africa as its economy **does not develop well** **whereas** the all aspects of progress in America is not too bad as its flourished economy.

**On the other hand, the others aspects of progress going to be important if a country already had a powerful economy.

### Original:

Nowadays, more and more governments take the economic improvement to the most important place, it is reasonable and genuinely help a lot. But some people think that the other types of improvement in our society is equivalent necessary likewise. For instance, human healthy, environment, entertainment and so on.

In terms of aim to the economy, It is certainly a important part of a country. The other types of progress couldn't practice well if a country's economy doesn't strong enough, it is a basis of anything else. Besides, in certain case, the advance of economy could help the other aspects of society. For instance, academy, healthy, and environment is poor in Africa as its economy is unlikely well and the all aspects of progress in America is not too bad as its flourished economy.

On the another hand, however, the others aspects of progress going to be important if a country already had a powerful economy. The civilians rather demand more satisfaction for their livelihood, entertainment, or ideology than a dominant country, otherwise the economy couldn't growing fast. For an average, if he had progressive competence in their work depending on what kind of live they're living.

In conculsion, my outlook is that whether the economic progress needs to be the first goal of government is based on the economy condition of the country. For the developed countries, all aspects of the progress of society are important equally. And vice versa, undeveloped countries need to put the economic progress to their first place.
