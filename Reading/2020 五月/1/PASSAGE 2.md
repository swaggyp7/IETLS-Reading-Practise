## Nanotechnology: its development and uses

**A** Nanotechnology has been <u>hailed</u> by many as being a twentieth-century miracle of science. Essentially, nanotechnology, a term derived from Greek, translating literally as 'dwarf technology' is, as the origin of its name suggests, engineering at the atomic level. ( *纳米科技这个名词本质上上是源于希腊，字面意思是“dwarf technology”，正如他名字的来源所表明，是原子级别的工程* )Scientists work with particles of substances known as 'nanoparticles' which may measure no more than 1 nanometre or a billionth of a metre.( *科学家研究的是被称为“纳米颗粒”，尺寸可能不到1纳米单位或十亿分之一米大小物质颗粒。* ) That's around 40,000 times smaller than the width of the average human hair. （ *大概比平均人类身高小40000倍* ）**Whilst some of these substances derived from carbon compounds are manufactured, others, such as metals, are naturally-occurring or arise as a by-product of another process e.g. volcanic ash or smoke from wood burning.**（ *虽然这些物质中有些是源于被制造的炭化合物，但其他一部分源于天然生成的或随其他过程产生的副产品，例如火山灰和木头燃烧的烟尘* ） What makes these substances of such scientific interest is that their <u>minute</u> size <u>facilitates</u> medical and technological processes that would otherwise be impossible.( *纳米颗粒微小的体积让在其他科技无法实现的医疗或技术进程成为可能，这就是它为什么科学家对它有如此的兴趣* )

**B** It may be something of a revelation for many of us to learn that nanotechnology - or its concept - is far from cutting-edge science.( *这可能对于我们学习纳米技术或它的概念来说是某种启示，但实际上离前沿科学还很远* ) **In fact, nanotechnology as an idea was first referred to in an influential lecture by American physicist, Richard Feynman, as far back as 1959. During the lecture, entitled 'There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom', Feynman outlined the basic concept of nanotechnology**.( *实际上，纳米技术是被美国物理学家XXX在1959年一个颇具影响力的讲座上提出，讲座被命名为《底部还有充足的空间》，他建立了纳米技术的基本概念框架* ) Individual atoms and molecules, he claimed, could in the future be created by a physical process.( *他声称在未来，每个原子和分子都可以通过物理过程创造出来* ) **Such a process, he <u>envisaged</u>, would involve the building of a set of precise tools to build and operate another <u>proportionally</u> smaller set.**( *他展望到，这样的过程将涉及到构建一套精密的工具，并用来构建和生成另一套比例更小的.* ) **The building of increasingly minute tools at the microscopic level would in turn produce ultra-microscopic materials, later to become known as 'nanoparticles'.**( 随着在微观层级越来越小的精密工具的建造，随之产出超微观的材质，后来被称之为“纳米颗粒” )

**C** **Strangely, what should have <u>sparked</u> a scientific revolution / was then virtually forgotten about for the next 15 years**.( *奇怪的是，本该引起科学革命的技术却在随后的15年中几乎被遗忘。*  ) In 1974, a Japanese scientist, Norio Taniguchi, of the Tokyo University of Science reintroduced Feynman's theory and put a new name to an old concept, referring to the science as 'nanotechnology'. ( 在1974年，一个名为XXX的日本科学家在XXX再次介绍了美国物理学家Feynman的理论，并给这项旧概念取了一个新名字，“纳米科技” )**However, it wasn't until nearly a decade later, in the 1980s, that the way was <u>paved</u> for nanotechnology to leave the <u>realm</u> of theoretical science and become reality.**( *然而，这仍然没有引发技术革命，直到在将近10年后的1980年，纳米科技才从脱离理论科学的领域并变为现实。* ) **Two major scientific developments within a relatively short period were to enable practical application of nanotechnology**.( 在相对短的周期内有两个重大科学发展实现了纳米技术的实际应用 ) **The invention of the Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM), combined with the discovery of nano-sized particles termed 'fullerenes', were to prove a turning point in nanotechnology.**( STM的发明和纳米级颗粒“fullerenes”的发现，为纳米科技的发展提供了转折点 )

**D** Fullerenes are derived from carbon molecules and, in common with other nanoparticles, possess chemical and physical properties that are of huge scientific interest.( *Fullerenes 源于碳分子，并且与其他纳米颗粒有共同点-同时拥有物理和化学属性引起了强烈的科学兴趣* ) The potential value of fullerenes for medical science was first raised in 2003 and in 2005 when the scientific magazine 'Chemistry and Biology' ran an article describing the use of fullerenes as light-activated antimicrobial agents.( Fullerenes在医学领域的潜力在2003年被首次提出，并在2005年科学杂志“XXX”发表了关于Fullerenes在XXX领域的使用。 ) Since then, fullerenes have been used for several biomedical applications ranging from X-ray imaging to treating cancer by targeting cancer cells.( 在那之后，Fullerenes被用在一些生物科学使用中，从X光映像到治疗癌症 ) In addition, these nanoparticles have been used in the manufacture of commercial products, from <u>sunscreen( 防晒霜 )</u> to <u>cosmetics</u> and some food products.( 而且，这些纳米颗粒也被使用在贸易产品的生产，从防晒霜到一些食品 ) Furthermore, nanoparticles of metals, like gold and silver, have been used in environmental clean-ups of oil slicks and other forms of pollution. ( 除此之外，例如金和银等金属中的纳米颗粒，也被用在清理浮油和其他形式的环境污染 )The remarkable properties of nanoparticles are down to two main factors: their greater surface-to-weight ratio, compared to larger particles which promotes the attachment of substances to their surface, and their minute size which allows them to penetrate cell membranes.( 可观的纳米粒子特性取决于两个事实： 他们极佳的表重比，相比容易附着其他杂质在表面的较大物质，还有纳米例子的极小尺寸允许他们穿透细胞壁 ) These properties are of great benefit, for example in medicine, as drugs to fight cancer or AIDS can be attached to nanoparticles to reach their target cell in the human body. ( 这些特质有很大的好处，例如在医学领域，治疗癌症的药物可以附着在纳米粒子上使得其直接命中人体中的癌细胞 )

**E** However, despite the amazing properties attributed to nanoparticles such as fullerenes, nanotechnology has yet to win wider universal acceptance in scientific circles.( 尽管纳米颗粒有如此多的惊人特性，例如fullerenes，但还是没有在科学圈中得到广泛的认可 ) For the very properties that make nanoparticles so valuable to technology and medical science are also the ones that make them potentially so toxic.( 使得纳米科技在医学和科学领域有价值的特性也使得它具有潜在的毒性 ) Such properties are potentially <u>lethal</u> if toxic substances attach themselves to the same nanoparticles, thereby delivering a fatal toxin through the cell membranes into the cells themselves.( 这些特质使得其能使有毒物质也附着在纳米分子上，并且通过其进入到细胞中，这是可能致命的 ) The toxic effect of these compounds is further increased, since their size permits them to enter the bloodstream and hence the body's major organs. ( 通过这种方式，有毒物质的危害会远远增加，应为纳米粒子的体积允许他们进入血管，并且通向人体重要器官中 )Furthermore, the nanoparticles in themselves are essentially a foreign element being introduced to the body.( 除此之外，在他们体内的纳米颗粒，本质上是被引入体内的外来元素。 ) Unlike foreign elements, such as bacteria, the body has no natural immune system to deaI with these ultramicroscopic particles. ( 不像细菌一类的外来元素，人体没有任何免疫系统可以处理这些微小颗粒 )Scientists have yet to convince the nanotechnology sceptics that the potential side effects of nanoparticles are more than compensated for by the advantages that they confer.( 科学家已经在尝试通过说明这些潜在副作用相比其带来的优势是可以接受的，说服纳米技术质疑者 ) It may be, however, that opposition to this technology is no more than a general <u>distrust</u> of scientific innovation.( 尽管，可能对这个技术的质疑不过是人们对科技创新的普遍质疑罢了 ) In fact, Urban Wiesing from the University of Tubingen has been quoted as saying 'Many of the risks associated with nanotechnology have at least been encountered in part in other technologies as well.'( 事实上来自XXX大学的XXX说过： 纳米技术的许多风险至少在别的科技上也遇到过 ) He also believes that regulations can be put in place to minimise such risks.( 他也相信制定法规可以将风险最小化 ) This is a view echoed by the Federal Environment Agency that proposes that such risks are vastly outweighed by the potential benefits of nanotechnology, in particular for the environment.( 这个观点也被联邦环境机构赞成，纳米技术所带来的利益远远超出其风险，特别是环境方面 )
