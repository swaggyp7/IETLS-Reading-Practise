## S1

Good morning, can I help you?

Yes, I've just been accepted on the course at the University. And I'd like to try and arrange the accommodation in the hall of residence.

Yes, certainly. Please sit down. **What I'll do is fill in a form with you to find out a little more about your preferences and <u>so forth</u>**.

Thank you.

So, first of all, can I take your name?

It's Anu Bhatt.

Could you spell your name, please?

Yes.

Thanks, And could I ask your date of birth?

31 March 1972.

Thank you, and where are you from?

India.

Alright. And then what will you be studying?

I'm doing a course in nursing.

Right, thank you. And how long would you want to stay in the hall, do you think?

Well, It'll take 3 years, But I'd only like to stay in hall for two, I'd like to think about living outside for the third year.

Fine, and what did you have in mind for <u>catering</u>? Do you want to cook for yourself, or have all your meals provided, that's <u>full board</u>?

Is there something in between?

Yes, you can just have evening meal provided, which is half board.

That's what I'd prefer.

Yes, um, a lot of students opt for that. Now, with that in mind. Do you have anything special diet, anything we should know about it?

Yes, I don't take red meat.

No red meat.

No, thinking about the room itself, we have a number of options, you can have a single study bedroom or you can have a shared one. These're both what we called simple rooms. The other alternative is to opt for a single bedsit, which actually has more space and better facilities. There are about 20 pounds a week difference between them.

Well, actually my <u>grant</u> is quite generous and I think the bedsit sounds the best option.

Lovely. I'll put you down for that and we will see what availabilities is like. Now, can I ask some other personal details which we like to have on record?

Yes, of course.

I wonder if you could let us know what your interests are. This might help us get a closer match for placing you in a particular hall.

Emm. Well, I love the theater.

Right?

And I enjoy sports, particularly <u>badminton</u>.

Ah, that's worth knowing. Now, what we finish with on the form is really a list from you of what your priorities are in choosing a hall. And we'll do our best to <u>take these into account</u>.

Well, the first thing is I prefer a hall where there are other mature students if possible.

Yes, we do have halls which tend to cater for the slightly older students.

And, I'd prefer to be out of the town.

That's actually good for you because we tend to have more vacancies in out-of-town halls.

Lucky.

Anything else?

Well, I'd like somewhere with a shared area, a TV room, for example, or something like that. It's a good way to socialize.

Certainly is.

That's it.

Now we just need a contact telephone number for you.

Oh, it's 667549.
