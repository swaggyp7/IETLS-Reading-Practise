# Hometown

## Has your hometown changed much these years?

Absolutely! Lots of stuff change a lot, and the traffic system is the most obvious change that I can notice and really enjoy its benefits every day. The brand new city highway system had been built in my hometown these years, and after that, The commute time from my home to the downtown area is cut in half. That's pretty efficient and changed my lifestyle.

## Is that a big city or a small place?

Emm. It's not so big but never small, I thought. There were 18 counties in my city and more than 1000 square kilometers of the tract. But it's only big literally, for the economy and social influence, not as big as well.

Orange, which is my favorite fruit and the most popular production export from our city. It's sweet with a little sour and tasty with juicy. And flavor aside, it's pushing our economy up as well.
