## TASK 2

***Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes (for example working for a charity, improving the neighbourhood or teaching sports to younger children).\***

***To what extent do you agree or disagree?\***

Write at least 250 words.

There are both advantages and disadvantages to let the high school students to join the community service compulsorily. Hence, in this case, I'm on the fence.

First of all, free community service certainly had some benefits for a teenager who study in high school. It is no doubt that letting students work in retirement homes as a volunteer would deepen their responsibility of the society, furthermore, they could also learn some practical living skills from their work. Provided optimal condition, It is absolutely worthwhile to enact this operation.

However, it is not gernerally benefitial formula for all students around the world, it's depends on the environment of academy wherein the country that students study in. The study work is extremely stressful for some students, especially in some Asia country. Such as China, high school students should always study in school for about 10 hours per day, or they might lose their opportunity for join the college as the competition is exceptionally hard, thus there was no time to participate other activities. Moreover, parents would rather let their children join the after-class tutor than just waste time in useless community services.

Overall, whether community service should be a compulsory part for high school students not only consider the advantages on its own, but also bases on the condition of the academic environment of the students.
