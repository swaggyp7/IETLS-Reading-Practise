# ***\*Study or work\****

## Do you work or are you a student?

I'm a software engineer. I had been engaging in this job for 3 years since I graduated from my college. I'd say I'm born for it, and pretty interested in this job.

## Why did you choose to do that type of job?

I'm a literally 'geek' since I was a child. First contact with computers at 6 years old, and after that, I almost stay with them every day

## Do you like your job?

Sure, of course. I love my job, which is challenging, and have some fabulous open-source communities. And it's also rewarding, I could do the things that I favored and get a rewarding income every month, how couldn't I like it?

## Do you miss being a student?

Yes, I definitely do, as you can see, I'm 23 now, however, I have 4 years of employment experience. It means that I had never been a student in college, I mean, full-time college. I had a part-time college certificate actually. But I guess I don't regret it. Although sometimes I thought, what if I join the college, is it will be better than now? But, who knows? Maybe I can't even be a programmer if I join the college.

## Is it very interesting?

Most of time, it is. The interesting part is I must keep learning about the cutting-edge technique for improving my program performance and doing my job efficiently, cuz it's updating so fast. It's really a challenge but very interested. And the boring part is-sometime, I must do the nonsense work repetitively for all afternoon, just like.. copy from there and paste on here.

## Is there any kind of technology you use at work?

Yes, being a programmer, I only need a computer, whatever is a laptop or desktop. If you give me a computer, I can bring anything to you.

## Can you manage your time well when you work

Yes, time managing is important, especially for a programmer. Every times when the tons of work pressure on me, if I can't manage my time well, I'm done. I usually separate my task into detail first, and then set the priority and deadline to them. This method is really help me to finish my task efficiently.

## Who helps you most at work?

Myself, honestly, I'm a self-oriented person. I'd rather trust myself than others. So when I met the problem that I don't know, I'd searching on google and find the answer by myself.
