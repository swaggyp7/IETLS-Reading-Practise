## The Final Frontier for Tourism

**A**

For some reason humankind has always looked towards the stars and dreamt of one day making the voyage into the unknown and exploring outer space.( 因为某些原因，人们总是向往着星辰，幻想着某一天能够远征未知领域，探索外太空 ) Perhaps it is our innate curiosity, perhaps the challenge presented by the <u>seemingly</u> impossible; (或许这是我们天生的好奇心，获取这个挑战看起来不可能  )whatever the lure, the <u>quest</u> to venture into space has become an <u>obsession</u> for many.( 不管怎样的诱惑，对太空的探索变成了许多人的执念  )

**B**

On a memorable July day in 1969 one man made a giant leap for his kind.( 在1969年7月令人难忘的一天，一个男人为人类跨出了巨大的的一步 ) Neil Armstrong touched down on the moon as the world watched with <u>bated</u> breath.（ 全世界屏息凝望着阿姆斯特朗登上了月球 ） **Was this a beginning or the <u>culmination</u> of years of <u>endeavour</u> that pushed science to its very limits?** ( 这是将科学推向极限的努力的开端还是结束？ )Well, it has been a long time indeed since the last moon landing, more than 40 years, but science has not <u>stood still</u> in the <u>interim</u>, nor have our dreams become any less ambitious.( 好吧，这是一个长久以来的事实，那就是人类距离上一次踏上月球已经是40多年前，但在这期间，科学并没有止步不前，也不是我们的梦想没有了志向 ) According to NASA, plans are <u>afoot</u> for a <u>manned</u> mission to Mars at some point after 2020.( 根据NASA所表，2020后的某个时间点载人登录火星计划正在进行中 ) A return to the moon has been scheduled sooner( 重返月球计划很快就会排上日程 ) - perhaps 2018 if NASA's new Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) is <u>rolled out</u> on <u>lime</u>.( 可能就在2018年，NASA CEV会在(石灰？)上发布 ) It may not be Hollywood <u>razzle-dazzle-style</u> progress;( 这可能不是什么好莱坞炫酷式的进步 ) **it may even be <u>painstakingly</u> slow, but <u>rest assured</u> that plans are afoot for something very ambitious and special indeed, and NASA may be back in the headlines making waves and history again, just as it did on that faithful day in 1969, in the not-too-distant future.**( 这甚至会十分艰难刻苦，但请放心，一项雄心壮志和具有特殊意义的计划正在进行中，可能在不远的未来，NASA将会重回巅峰再创历史，就如1969年那样 )

**C**

That said, it is the prospect of space tourism for the <u>masses</u> that has captured the headlines recently, and this may not be such a distant dream as people would expect( 也就是说，宇宙旅行前景最近将成为头条热点，而且这并没有人们想象的那么遥远 ). In 2001, an American multimillionaire, Dennis Tito, became the first space tourist, spending ten days on the International Space Station along with his crew of Russian <u>cosmonauts</u>, and <u>fulfilling</u> a <u>lifelong</u> ambition in the process.( 2001年，美国的前万富翁 Dennis Tito成为了第一个太空旅行者，随着的俄罗斯太空团队在国际空间站呆了10天，并在这过程中满足了他毕生的志向。 ) He described the experience rather paradoxically as 'indescribable'; ( 他将这段经历描述为“无法描述”，这相当的矛盾 )everything that he thought it would be and more.( 他认为会发生的一切 ) A year later, South African millionaire Mark Shuttleworth followed in his footsteps.( 一年后，南非百万富翁Mark Shuttleworth追随了他的脚步 ) On his return to Earth he said, 'every second will be with me for the rest of my life'. ( 他回来后，说到，我的余生将伴随着在上面的每一分每一秒 )Clearly these men had a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but this came at a <u>hefty</u> price, both paying $20 million for the <u>pleasure</u> of their space adventures.( 显然他们都经历了一生一次的体验，但是这十分昂贵，他们为了太空旅行都花费了2000万 )

**D**

At present, space tourism is undoubtedly reserved for an elite and wealthy few, but what of the future?( 现在，太空旅行显然是精英和贵族专属，但未来呢？ ) If Eric Anderson, president of Space Adventures, the company that organised Tito and Shuttleworth's trips, is to be believed, it will be the next big thing.( 如果人们相信正在组织一项Tito and Shuttleworth 旅行的Space Adventures 的总裁 Eric Anderson ，这将是下一个大事件 ) 'Everyone's looking for a new experience', he says. ( 他说，每个人都在寻求新体验 )Indeed, Space Adventures is planning to offer rocket trips to the public for $100,000 within the next few years, so perhaps space tourism is closer than we think( 确实，Space Adventures正计划着在接下来几年向大众提供10万美元的火箭旅行，所以，太空旅行可能并没有我们想的那么遥远 ). Another company, The Space Island Group, is planning to build a space hotel inspired by the spaceship in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey.( 其他公司，Space Island Group, 计划建造类似电影《2001》中的宇宙飞船的太空旅馆 ) Gene Meyers, the company's president, predicts that in 2020 a five-day holiday at the hotel will cost less than $25,000.( Gene Meyers，Space Island Group的总裁，预计2020在年宇宙旅馆的5天假期仅需要不超过25000美元 ) Imagine, he says, a five-star hotel with all the usual luxuries, except that each morning you'll be greeted by mind-blowing views of outer space.( 想象一下，住在每天睁眼就能看见外太空的美景，5星规格的酒店中 ) This is certainly food for thought for adventure-seeking holiday planners.( 这确实是寻求冒险的假期的计划者的值得考虑的 ) That said, unless there is a serious <u>spike</u> in inflation between now and 2020, $25,000 will still remain a considerable sum of money to have to part with for a <u>recreational</u> activity, once-in-a-lifetime or not.( 也就是说，除非现在到2020年的这段时间内发生严重的通货膨胀，不然25000美元用来体验一次娱乐性活动仍然一笔不小的消费，不论是不是一生一次的活动 ) But that is perhaps missing the point -the prospect of affordable space travel is getting closer and closer and it is only a matter of time before it becomes a reality.( 但这可能遗漏了一点-可负担的太空旅行已经离我们越来越近，这成为现实只是时间问题 )

**E**

Other companies have even more ambitious plans.( 其他公司也有许多雄心壮志的计划 ) Bigelow Aerospace is spending close to $500 million on a project to build a 700-metre spaceship to fly tourists to the moon.( Bigelow Aerospace 正花费将近5亿美元来建造一艘700米的太空船来载乘客飞向月球 ) The spaceship will be able to hold 100 guests, each with a private room offering truly unique views of the Earth's sunset.( 飞船能容纳100名旅客，给每一个人带来独一无二的地球日落的美景 ) Even the Hilton Hotel Group wants to get in on the act with talk of plans to build a Hilton on the moon.( 甚至希尔顿酒店想在月球上建一家希尔顿 ) For the present, only millionaires can enjoy the privilege of a space journey, but in the words of one Bob Dylan, 'The times they are a changing.' And sooner than you'd think.( 现在，虽然只有土豪们有太空旅行都特权，但正如Bob Dylan所说的，“时间在变，并且比你想象的要快” )
