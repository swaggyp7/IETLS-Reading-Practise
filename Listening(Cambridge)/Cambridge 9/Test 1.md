Good evening, King's restaurant.

Good evening, I'm ringing about the job I understand you have vacant.

Oh, yes

I'd like to find out a few more details if I may

Yes, of course. can take your name?

It's Peter Chin.

OK Peter, well, if want to ask about the job, and then if we're both still interested, we could arrange for you to come for an interview

Great, thanks. I'm afraid I miss the advert for the job but heard it about it from a friend.

That's no problem at all. What would you like to know?

Well, um, what sort of work is it - washing up?

It's answering the phone.

Oh, right, fine.

And not waiting at table.

That'd be good, and how many nights a week would it be?

Well, we're really only busy at the weekend.

So, two nights?

Three actually, so it would work out at twelve hours a week.

That'll be fine, It wouldn't interfere with my studies.

Are you at the university?

Yes, First year Physics student.

Alright.

Um, and because I'm not an EU national would I need a work permit?

Yes, you would. Just get your tutor to sign it.

That wouldn't be a problem if I <u>were</u> to get a job. Um, where exactly is the restaurant?

Well, we have two branches, the one we're recruiting for is in HillsdunneRoad.

Um, I don't know that, How do you spell it, please?

It's H-i-double l-s-d-u-double n-e Road

Emm, got that, thanks, Is it near a bus stop?

Yes, the nearest one would probably be just beside the library.

Oh yes, I know it. That would be fine for me. And could I ask about the pay?

We're offering 4.45 pounds an hour.

That's very good. My last job was 3.95 pounds an hour.

We <u>fell it's</u> pretty good and we also offer some good fringe benefits.

Really?

Well, we give you a free dinner so you eat well.

Right, better than hostel food.

We certainly hope so, and we also offer extra pay for working on national holiday.

Oh that's a really good perk, isn't it?

Yes we think so. And then because of the difficulties of getting public transport, if you're working after the 11 clock we drive you home.

Oh, that's good to know.

Well, we'd certainly still be interested in inviting you for interview if you're still interested.

Oh yes, certainlly. Could I just also ask what qualities you're looking for?

Well, for this particular job, we want a clear voice which you obviously do have.

Thanks.

And you must be able to think quickly, you know?

### Section 2

Now we go to Jane who is going tell us about what is happening in town this weekend.

Right, thanks Andrew, and now on to what's new, and Do we really need yet another sport shop in broadcaster? Well, most of you probably know Sport World, the branch of Danish sport goods company that opened a few years ago. It's attracted a lot of custom, and so the company has now to decided to open another branch in the area. It's going to be in the shopping center to the west broadcaster. So it's would be a good new for all of you who've found the original shop in the north of the town hard to get to. I was invited to special preview, and I can promise you, this is the ultimate in sport retailing. The whole place has been given a new <u>minimalist</u> look with company's signature colors of black and red. The first three floors have a huge range of sport clothing as well as equipment. And on the top floor, there is a cofe and a book and DVD section. You'll find all the well-known names as well as some less well-known ones. If they haven't got exactly what you want in stock, they promise to get it for in ten days. Unlike the other store, where it can take up to fourteen days. They covered all the major sports, including football, tennis and swimming, but they particularly focus on running. And they claim to have the widest range of equipment in the country. As well as that, A whole section of the third floor is devoted to sports bags, including the latest design from the states. If you can't what you want here,  it doesn't exist.

The shop will be open from 9 a.m this Saturday and if you go along to the opening, you'll have a chance to meet the National 400 meters running champion Paul King, who's coming along to open the shop. And he'll be staying around until about <u>midday</u>, to chat to any fans who want to meet him and sign autographs. 

Then there will be a whole range of special attractions all weekend. There will be free tickets for local sporting events, for the first 50 customers. And also, the special competition open to all. Just answer 15 out of 20 sports questions correctly, to win a signed copy of Paul king's DVD 'spring tips'. While the first person to get all the questions correct gets a year's free membership of the broadcaster Gym. All entrants will receive the special sports calendar with details of all broadcaster's <u>fixtures</u>(英：活动) in the coming year.

One of the special opening <u>offers</u> is a fitness test. A complete review of your xxx and muscle tone. Actually done in the shop by qualified staff. This would normally cost 30 pounds, but it's available at half price for this month only. There're only a limited number of places available for this, so to make a booking phone 560341. In addition, if you open an account, you'll get lots more special offers.
