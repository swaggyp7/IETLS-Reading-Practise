However, the teenage population change is comparable gradual, which is only 2.8% decrease over 50 years.

Nowadays, the accounts of public sports locales were increased rapidly according to the devlopment of economy which gave residents more chance to improve health by exercising accordingly. However, it will not be the only way that help people keep healthy, the other methods are prominent likewise.

Sporting is definitely benefitial for people's health. The sports facilities more intensive means that people would have more chances and motivations to going to sport. For example, lots of people want to exercise but were inhibited by a long commute from gym. People would like to put the phone down and go to gym if it just hundreds meters far away, thus, build more and more sports facilities is certainly useful for improving public health. 

However, adding more sports locale is not the only way to promote public health. The others are also crucial, like improve healthy resources, reduce pollution emission or improve importance of sports class in school as people won't  keep healthy by just exercising if they inhale noxious air every day. Hence, it is true that increasing sports facilities is important, but other measures are prominent too.

The aim for advance public health is painstaking, which necessitated the improvement of the multiple aspects of society and couldn't succeed by just one or two change.
