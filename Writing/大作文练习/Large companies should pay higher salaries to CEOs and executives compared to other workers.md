Large companies should pay higher salaries to CEOs and executives compared to other workers. 

To what extent do you agree or disagree?

agree, CEOS generally more competent than other workers.

Opposite:

Other works do the more work than CEOs.

CEO only give a direction or plan, workers need enact



CEOs had responsibility more than others

if things going bad, most of criticism will point to CEOs

CEO had more competent than others



In today's competitive environment, does CEOs deserve their high salaries in top-level firms? Some people think so. I align myself with them and I will elucidate my views in forthcoming paragraphs and illustrate some relevant exemplifications.

To begin with, "run the organization" is not as sample as we thought about. First and foremost, the responsibility: The duties that administrators carry on is much heavy than those for others. To explicate, the duties that senior manager in top-level corporation burden with are heavy that we have ever thought, since every decisions of them must be elaborated and correct, or the tonnes of criticism will press on them when the advent of failure. Thereby, people's remuneration ought to depends on how responsibility they carried on.

Furthermore, experience is also crucial. A high-level executive must be experienced and sophisticated. To explain, they must keep calm when the emergency which may let company fall and also need to grasp any opportunities in the financial market that may benefit corporation. None of both could be done without experience. Instead of the other staffs work step by step by using their physical, experience and ideology more important for the senior executives.

Overall, as the given reasons above, the people who are administering organization deserve higher wages compared to the others who are unable to do that, since their empirical competence and the responsibilities they are carrying on.

It is fashionable today to bash big corporations. And there is one trending issue in people's sight: CEO pay. Some people believe senior managers deserve their huge bucks compared to the other workers' wages. I completely align myself with this point and will explicate my views in forthcoming paragraphs and give some relevant exemplifications.

To begin with, at least for the majority of large firms, "run the organization" is not as simple as we thought, generally being a tough errand instead. To elucidate, first and foremost, the responsibilities: the duties that senior-level executives burden with are much heavy than those for others. They must ensure their plans or directions are elaborated and correct, one way or another, or inflict tonnes of blame when the advent of failures. Thereby, the one who burdens with such a pressure on their shoulder deserve higher wages compare to the another who just need to do their work step by step.

In addition, sophistication and experience are also required for the senior official who needs to run the corporation smoothly. To explain, they ought to have a smart sense of the financial market and grasp the opportunity immediately with their empirical sights. And they also need to organize the company from top to bottom, it is hard for a normal staff without experience.

In conclusion, as the reasons above, the high-level CEOs deserve their higher bucks as compare to the smaller of the other staffs since the experience they had, and the responsibilities they burden with.



Original:

Nowadays, some people thought large companies should give better benefits to executives than the other workers, I my outlook, I agree with this point, but it depends on how competent that CEOs had, and how many profits they brought to corporate.

Admittly, every one in a corporate had their own value, it seems to be unfair to unrewarding the other workers. The other workers generally did more works than executives. And most of them were as industrious as their CEOs, even some of them more diligent than their CEOs. Furthermore, in general, executives only need to give a direction or a plan, and other workers need do many times of job more than executives to enact their plans, if a incompetent give a wrong direction, it will be a disaster. Thus, the competence of CEOs is important.

However, competent CEOs and executives deserve their rewarding salaries. Firstly, executives had more responsibilities than the other workers, thence, the most of criticism will point to CEOs or executives if the things going bad. Because of they had duty on their own plans. Besides, in commonplace, CEOs and executives more sophisticated and competent than the other colleagues. Thus, they deserve higher wages as their higher responsibilities and elaborate plans.

To sum up, I would agree with the point that CEOs and executives deserve the higher wages. But not completely agree with it, because I my opinion, whether a company should pay higher salaries to CEOs or executives based on how competent that they possessed.

In this competitive era, most of the firms run by top-level executives. Therefore, gigantic industries ought to send the enormous amount to higher officials than their employees. I am in complete accord with the given ideology and the reasons for my opinion will be elucidated in the forthcoming paragraphs with a relevant illustration.

 To begin with, there are numerous reasons to support this notion. First and foremost, senior-level executives are more skilled. To explicate, company leaders are aware of new technologies and additional skills due to which they are highly able to run the business smoothly. Thereby, they deserve a hefty amount of salary as compared to other employees. For instance, as per a survey conducted by the London University in 2019, 80% of private sectors run by high profile people who have good knowledge to run the firm. Hence, the success rate of companies has been escalated to a great extend as compared to the government sectors. Therefore, it is evidence that CEOs truly deserve high payment for their duty. 

In addition to this, another major factor to favour this statement is that company leaders are well experienced by which they have to carry the whole burden of the industry on their shoulders. To explain, experienced one can run the job more accurately by carrying all the responsibilities of the job. As a result, the status of the factory improves with the efforts of their seniors. To exemplify, as per recent research done by The Times of India newspaper, the chairman of the Goggle company runs their business on his own as he has two decades of work experience. Consequently, he does not find any hindrance to run his association and also uplifts the status of his industry.  

To conclude, owing to reasons such as senior-level officials having extra skills and more experience, I agree with those who opine that top executives of  high-level companies should deserve more remuneration than regular employees.
