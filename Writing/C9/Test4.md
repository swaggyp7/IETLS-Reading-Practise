The given graph below shows the information of the depletion of energy in the USA from 1980 with projections to 2030.

In the overview, most kinds of the fuel consumption post a rise tendency, but the petrol and oil consumption are noticeable higher than others. And nuclear, wind, and hydropower keep the lower-than-aveage level as none of them are higher than 10 quadrillions.

Petro and oil, the noticeable one, started with 35 quadrillions since 1980, then fluctuate rapidly until 2005, which year it started rising gradually.

Apart from the top one, the coal and the gas are situated at second and thrid repectively. And have a similar phenomenon - wave dramatically before 2015. After that, the coal keep increasing steadily and the gas shows a steadiness.

The remainders, nuclear, wind and hydropower, started from the same position, 4% approximately. And remain slight fluctuating until 2007 approximately, then became static until the projection of the increase tendency in 2026, but hydropower is excepted, it's steady still.

The given graph below shows the data of different kinds of the consumption by fuel in the USA from 1980 with projections to 2030.

In the summary, most kinds of energy are pose upward trend with some fluctuation. Nuclear, wind, and hydropower change slightly and keep in the low consumption levels throughout 50 years, none of them higher than 10 quadrillions. The others, coal and gas, and petrol are rise gradually at all, but with some noticeable waves.

The low consumption levels engergy, nuclear, wind, and hydropower are situated in the same level at 1980, 4% approximately. And wave slightly since 1985 until 2010, then remain steady until a soar tendency at 2026, but hydropower is excepted, it remain constant still.

However,the coal and gas, rise rapidly compare with the low consumption levels, have a dramatical fluctuation before 2020, then the coal increase still but the gas remain static.

The most noticeable one, petrol and oil, higher than others at all time. It shows a gradually growth after 1995 - a quick wave before that time.

The given graph below shows data of (the) energy consumption of different kinds of energy in the USA between 1980 to 2030.

In general, most kinds of energy show~~s~~ (an) increase(upward*) tendency. Nuclear, solar/wind (,)and hydropower stay in(at) low level(s) and <u>keep gradual</u>(prevail consistency) thourghout(throughout) 50 years, <u>no one</u>(none of them) higher than 10 quadrillion(s) ~~units~~. And coal and gas, stand on the middle consumption level of all kinds. The <u>standout</u>(outstanding/**dramatic**/**noticeable**) ones, petrol and oil, (are) higher a lot~~s~~ than others.

~~For~~ the three kinds of low consumption level energy, nuclear, wind and hydropower. All of them <u>change gradually</u>(**remain stable/steady/static**), nuclear and wind <u>kept increase, overall</u>(**upward slightly at all**), but <u>a little decrease tendency in between 1990 and 2010</u>(**waves/fluctuate slightly between 1985 and 2005**). And hydropower, <u>alternate decrease between increase since 1980 until 2012, being stable.</u> (**recover from fluctuation before 2010 and remain constant**)

<u>(The) Other three kinds which have comparable higher consumption and wave considerably. Petrol and oil, coal and gas, change swiftly except gas after 2015, shows stable. And petrol and oil have a remarkable accounts higher than others, and in 2030 this account almost became double of coal's consumption, which is sceond.</u>
