The given flow chart introduces how wasted glass bottles are recycled.

In general, the process of recycling can divide into three steps. Firstly, the transportation of wasted glass bottles. Then, melt glass bottles into liquid. Finally, reproduce new bottles by using liquid glass.

Speaking of the transportation of glass bottles first, wasted glass bottles are sent to the collection point first and then are transported by trucks.

When it comes to the second stage, bottles are polished with high-pressure water and are separated by their color. After that, send them to the glass factory to break them into pieces and melt them in the furnace by fire between 600 degrees Celsius and 800 degrees Celsius. Finally, melted liquid glass is molded into bottles with new liquid glass. Finally, in the third step, new bottles are filled with the beverage and sent to markets for sale.
