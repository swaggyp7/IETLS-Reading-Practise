## Are the transport facilities in your city very good?

Yes, most of them. The only flaw is we don't have a metro/subway system. But in my opinion, it's neither here nor there, our city is not as big as needs the subway. My most proud of traffic facility is our city highway system. Which was bring us convenience and cut my commute time from my home to downtown in half.

## Which room does your family spend most of the time in?

â€‹	We love to stay in the living room as is the only place where we could enjoy our pastime together. I play my PlayStation and my parents watch TV.

## Do you live in a house or a flat?

We live in a flat which is situated in the north of our city, and in a neighborhood. We moved there 4 years ago. And recently, we have the plan to sell it and go to rent a house.

## Do you plan to live here for a long time?

I don't, cuz I have a job and I decide to live in Changsha, where is my work city and plan to buy a house here in the future.

## Do you live alone or with your family?

#### 1

Honestly, I prefer to live alone. I mean... it doesn't mean that I don't love staying with my family. Some said - distance makes beauty. Argues will arise inevitably if peoples stay together for a long time, not only family, and couples or friends as well.

#### 2

Honestly, I prefer to live alone. That means I'd have more time to enjoy myself and have more sense of privacy, I enjoy staying alone. Some said - distance makes beauty, maybe back home per week or month is a good idea for me. 

## How long have you lived there?

Maybe not more than 2 months, cuz I've joined the work as my family moved here. So I rarely go home and live here because of my job. The chances to go home only when national legal holiday every year. That sounds bad, right?

## What do you usually do in your house/flat/room?

Most of the time, for me, I play video games. I'm a literally game fan, thereby my favorite pastime is playing games. During the weekend, I can almost be playing the game all day. And other times, Movies or sporting by virtual reality is my second loved / a good complement.

## Which is your favourite room in your home?

The study room is the best, not a literal 'study' room. Well, at least it was really a room for study before. For now, it's a room where I could play video games on my computer or sporting with virtual reality. 

## What's the difference between where you are living now and where you lived in the past? (If you want to say you have not lived elsewhere)

The first difference is space, the room I rented is substantially smaller than the home where I lived before I joined the work. And second, is the feeling, the room I living now is a mess. And the contrary / And, thanks to my mother, my home is always kept tidy and clean. 

## What can you see when you look out the window of your room?

The sets of other buildings in the neighborhood. I guess most Chinese will see the same view that I described. Unless they live in the countryside or they're rich and live in a big house. It's really stressful and unpleasant, I prefer to see the blue sky and lush plants out of the window.

## Would you be willing to live in the countryside in the future?

Yes, maybe I will. I like the countryside, where is peaceful and close to nature. And the people living there are hospitable, apparently at least. But there's something I need concern about if I move here for real. First is the environment, there're lots of bugs in the countryside, and I hate bugs. Second, the inconvenience of shopping and express is a problem too.
