## 3D Printers

Ever wished you could find a pair of shoes to match your outfit? Fancy a pizza but don't want to go out or wait for your delivery service to arrive? Simple. All you need is a 3D home printer. **<u>Whilst</u> <u>admittedly</u> not yet mainstream technology, it is only a matter of time / until the 3D printer becomes as much a part of the domestic furniture / as the statutory TV or the washing machine**.(虽然 *3D打印机现在确实还不是主流技术，但它变成像电视或洗衣机一般流行只是时间问题。*) **Currently, however, the technology <u>remains firmly</u> in the <u>province</u>(*领域*) of <u>geeks</u>(*极客*) and <u>gadget</u>(*小玩意*) lovers.**( *然而，最近这项技术在极客和小玩意爱好者的领域中坚实存在着* )

### P2: 3D打印机简单的基本构造和运行原理

The design of the 3D home printer is <u>nevertheless refreshingly</u>（*形容词可忽略，不影响原意*） simple.(*家用3D打印机的设计却非常简单，令人耳目一新 / 让人十分新鲜*) Its components are relatively few, and could theoretically be assembled / by anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of mechanics / and technological <u>know-how</u>. The 3 main elements of the printer / are a metal framework / which contains / the mechanical part of the printer, a printer control board and a PC(*打印机有三个主要基本元素，分别是包含打印机机械部分的金属框架，打印机控制面板和电脑*). **The PC is connected via USB to the printer control board, which(*printer control board*) <u>in turn</u>(另一方向) is connected to the framework of the printer and attached to the side of the latter(*framework of the printer*)**( *电脑通过USB连接到打印机控制面板，控制面板则连接到打印机的框架上，并且附着在框架的侧边*). **A plastic <u>filament</u> of around 3m m in diameter <u>feeds into</u> the printer from an external source, connecting to the <u>extruder motor</u> inside the printer**( *三毫米直径的塑料 <u>纤维/细丝(filament)</u> 从外部的源头 <u>放入/接入(feed into)</u> 打印机内部，连接到内部的<u>挤压机(extruder motor)?</u> 上* ). During printing, the controlled movement of the extruder motor ensures the correct volume of plastic is used (*在打印过程中，受控制的压制机的运动确保塑料正确的用量*). The extruder motor in turn is connected to a heated extruder or 'hot end' that heats the plastic filament during printing（ *挤压机的另一头连接着在打印过程中给塑料加热的加热挤压机，或称为“热终端”* ）. As the heated plastic emerges or is 'extruded' to use the correct <u>terminology</u>, it cools and is arranged in layers to create a solid 3D model.( 在加热过的塑料出现时，或者用专业术语说是“压制”时，塑料会冷却然后被一层一层的排列成实体3D模型 )

### P3: 打印机三个轴承的控制

In order to move the extruder about in 3D space, there are 3 axes, each controlled by motors.( *为了在3D空间中移动挤压机，有三个被发动机控制的轴* ) The X-axis motor, located in a midway position on the metal framework of the printer, moves the extruder left and right, using a <u>pulley</u>.( *X轴发动机定位在金属框架的中介部分，用滑轮系统来控制左和右* ) The two Z-axis motors, which are located on either side of the heated printing bed, move the entire X-axis up and down via two threaded rods.( *两个Z轴分别在加热床的左右两边，利用螺纹杆控制整个X轴的移动* ) The heated bed of the printer, which lies directly underneath the hot end of the extruder, is moved back and forth beneath the extruder by the Y-axis motor located underneath the heated bed.( *加热床直接置于挤压机热端的下方，由在热床下方的Y轴发动机控制其在前后方向的移动* ) The bed is heated to around 70 degrees Celsius to ensure the newly laid plastic does not <u>warp</u> as( *在..时* ) it cools.( *热床被加热到70摄氏度左右，以确保新放在床上的塑料在冷却时不变形* ) Overall control of the printer <u>is effected</u> by the printer control board and the PC which contains the programme of the model that is being printed. ( *所有打印机的控制都由打印机面板和带有被打印模型程序的电脑实现* )

Once assembled, in theory it should be possible to print a 3D version of virtually anything. However, comparatively easy as it is to assemble, would-be DIY gadget enthusiasts should be warned that the printer has major technical limitations.( *虽然组装3D打印相对的容易，但想要成为极客的人需要知道3D打印机还是有较大技术限制的* ) The finished product will always have banding and surface detail remaining as evidence of how the model was laid down.( *完成的产品上会在表面上贴有条带和表面细节以确认如何放置* ) In addition, operators of the printer have to be extremely careful not to knock it whilst the machine is in the process of printing, since this will end up in model distortion.( *而且，打印机的操作者需要机器小心不要再运行时触碰它，否则会导致在结束时模型偏移* ) Extreme care also has to be taken in the choice of plastic filament which will <u>ultimately</u> create the structure of the model.( *也需要在最终创造模型结构的塑料丝的选择上小心* ) Some types of plastic may warp if the temperature is not controlled properly when the <u>melted</u> plastic leaves the <u>nozzle</u>, and later, when it is cooling on the bed.( *如果温度在操作不当，在融化的塑料从管口到床上冷却时会变形* ) Obviously the 3D model will be the same colour as the plastic filament forming it, but colour limitations can easily be overcome by painting afterwards for a multicolour finish.( *显然被打印出的3D模型的颜色都会是塑料丝的颜色，但颜色限制可以通过后期的喷绘克服* ) **Another problem is that the plastic structures have to be supported as they are laid down on the heated bed or they will distort or fall away as the plastic cools.**( *还有一个问题就是塑料结构防止在热床上时需要支撑，否则会导致模型便宜或在冷却时脱落* )

**It is virtually certain**, however, that such issues will be overcome in the future.( 然而，几乎可以肯定这些问题都会在未来被克服 ) The <u>innumerable</u> advantages of 3D printers far outweigh any disadvantages and justify time and resources spent on such technology. ( *3D打印机的数不清的优势远多于任何劣势，也会证明花在这项技术上的时间和资源都是值得的* )Firstly, the product can be produced on the spot within a very short time frame, thereby reducing time and cost of manufacturing by traditional means.( *首先，产品可以在现场以很短的时间被产出，因此减少传统生产的时间和成本花费* ) Secondly, printing objects on a 3D printer removes the need for storage space of items since whatever is required is printed as and when necessary.( 其次，3D打印机不需要储存空间，因为你可以只在需要时打印所需要的东西 ) Finally, despite expensive set-up costs, in the long run, 3D printing works out far cheaper than normal manufacturing processes since there is no longer a need for labour costs. ( *虽然安装费用较贵，但长远来看，3D打印机比传统制造过程便宜，因为他不再需要工人成本* )

However, the 3D printer is still very much in its early stages and can be <u>likened</u> to early home computers which in technological <u>hindsight</u> now seem so <u>cumbersome</u> and slow.( *然而，3D打印机当前还是处于早期阶段，可以把它比作现在看起来笨重缓慢的早期计算机* ) So far, early experimentations with the new technology have been impressive but not <u>earth-shattering</u>.( *目前为止，新技术的早期实验虽然令人影响深刻但并不是惊天动地的* ) Nevertheless, in the future that is all set to change. In fact, the potential of 3D printers is <u>jaw-dropping</u>. The most ambitious plan yet for 3D printing has to be in the military field.( 目前为止最有志向的计划在军事领域 ) **If all goes to plan, fighter planes will at some, probably very distant, point in the future carry printers on board that during flight will be capable of printing out other fighter planes to replenish the flying squad**. ( *如果一切按计划执行，在未来的某一天，或许非常遥远，战斗机将搭载打印机，使其可以在飞行途中打印出其他飞机来补充飞行编队* ) Admittedly, it takes a quantum leap of the imagination to accept that a machine that prints out clothing and pizzas will also be able to print out planes.( *确实很难让人接受打印衣服和披萨的机器也可以打印飞机* ) ***Sceptics*, however, should remember that one of the <u>forerunners</u> to the modern computer, designed in the mid-twentieth century, filled an entire room, So, in theory, if we have come so far in a matter of years then who knows what the future may hold for 3D printers?**
