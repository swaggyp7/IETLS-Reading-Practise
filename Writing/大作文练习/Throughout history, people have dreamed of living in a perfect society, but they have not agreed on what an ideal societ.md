Throughout history, people have dreamed of living in a perfect society, but they have not agreed on what an ideal society would be like. 

What do you think is the most important element of a perfect society in the modern world?

How can people work towards achieving an ideal society?

Neither today nor the hundreds years ago, human never stop following a perfect society. However, it is impossible to create a perfect society which would satisfy everyone in the world. In my mind, a ideal society consist of free education, free health care, and free speech, I will elucidate my views in forthcoming paragraphs and illustrate some exemplifications about how to achieve it.

First and foremost, a ideal society needs the free speech. People can not disseminate their knowledge, ideology, and opinion well in a closet environment, thus society can not develop positively as the censorship will destory people's mind and limit people's horizons. Secondly, educational environment is prominant as well. For some low income groups, they can not afford educational expenses even their children are capable of entering the university. Thence, exempting tuitions can ease the pressure of low income household. As the same way, free health care can also alleviate the number of people deceases by can not afford expenses of medication.

To achieve these goal, it is never be easy. Speaking of the free speech first, it is necessitate democratizing to some tyrannies, as the authoritarians would never allow residents have their own mind, and free speech or liberal media is impossible as well. As far as free education and free health care are concerned, these ambitions to achieve needs a powerful socioeconomy, one way or another. Thus, we need contribute our abilities to society as much as possible to foster the economic development of our society. I believe one day it will come true when our society have strong economy.

To sum up, a perfect society must let people say anything what they want as this is the only way to disseminate people's mind and knowledge. Secondly, we need contribute positively to society to achieve the goal of free education and health care.
