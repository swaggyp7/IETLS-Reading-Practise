The given pie charts indicate the percentage of three types of the electricity produced in India, Sweden, Morocco, and Vietnam from 2003 to 2008.

Overall, fossil fuel was more popular in India, and Vietnam, and it was noticeable that there was no country used nuclear power except India. In contrast, instead of fossil fuel, hydropower was the majority type for producing electricity in Morocco and Sweden.

In terms of India and Vietnam, the most evident difference is that the Vietnam never used nuclear power but India did. Further more, the consumption of fossil fuel for producing electricity accounted for 82% in India, which was also the highest in four countries. And the rest of electricities in India were produced by hydropower and nuclear power, which comprised 14% and 4%, respectively.

When it comes to Morocco and Sweden, hydropower was the majority type of electricity producing in both nations. Especially in Morocco, which made up 95% of total, and took the first in given countries. Nevertheless, Morocco did not seize nuclear technology, thus Morocco never used nuclear power as Vietnam. Finally, nuclear power was most matured in Sweden as there were 44% electricities pro duced by nuclear power.
