### **Attitudes to Language**

It is not easy to be systematic and objective about language study. 

系统性和客观性学习语言并不简单

Popular linguistic debate regularly deteriorates into <u>invective</u> and <u>polemic</u>. Language belongs to everyone, so most people feel they have a right to hold an option about it. 

流行的语言辩论议题逐渐恶化称谩骂和争论。语言属于每个人，所以，每个人都有权利对此发表自己的看法。

And when options differ, emotions can run high. Arguments can start as easily over minor points of usage as over major policies of linguistic education.

当意见不同时，情绪就会爆发。争论可以从微小的语言用法开始，也可以从语言教育政策发生。

Language, moreover, is a very public behavior, so it is easy for different usages to be noted and criticised. No part of society or social behavior is <u>exempt</u>.

除此之外，语言，这是非常公众的行为，所以很容易因为不同的用法被评价和批评。任何的社交行为都不能被豁免。

 Linguistic factors influence how we judge personality, intelligence, social status, educational standards, job aptitude, and many other areas of identity and social survival. As a result, it is easy to hurt, and to be hurt, when language use is unfeelingly attacked.

语言的因素影响着我们对他人个性，智商，社会状态，教育标准，工作天赋，其他身份领域和社会生存的评判。作为结果，当语言使用不当时，很容易伤害别人，和被伤害。

**In its most general sense, prescriptivism is the view that one variety of language has an inherently higher value than others and that this ought to be imposed on the whole of the speech community. The view is propounded especially in relation to grammar and vocabulary, and frequently with reference to pronunciation.** 

在多数情况下，prescriptivism认为一种语言比其他语言有更高的内在价值，这也应该强加到所有语言群体。这一观点常常被语法和词汇中提出的，也频繁的涉及到发音

The variety which is favoured, in this account, is usually a version of the ‘standard’ written language, especially as encountered in literature, or in the formal spoken language which most closely reflects this style. 

在这种情况下，最受欢迎的这种语言，常常作为‘标准’写作语言，特别是在文学领域或特别容易反映出这种情况的正式场合口语中

**Adherents to this variety are said to speak or write ‘correctly’ deviations from it are said to be ‘incorrect’.**

这种语言的追随者被称为正确的说或写作的标准，而与他们不同的人则被认为是错误的。

All the main languages have been studied prescriptively, especially in the 18th century approach to the writing of grammar and dictionaries. 

所有主流语言都被研究过，特别是在18世纪的语法和字典写作中

The aims of these early grammarians were threefold:

早期语言学家目标以下3点：

 (a) they wanted to <u>codify</u> the principles of their languages, to show that there was a system beneath the apparent chaos of usage; 

A：想将他们语言的原则编入法典，用来展示在表面上对语言的混乱使用下是有完整的语言系统的；

(b) they wanted a means of settling disputes over usage, 

B：他们想要解决语言使用争议的方法

and (c) they wanted to point out what they felt to be common errors, in order to ‘improve’ the language. 

C：为了改善语言，他们想要指出他们认为的常见错误

**The <u>authoritarian</u> nature of the approach is best <u>characterized</u> by its <u>reliance</u> on ‘rules’ of grammar.** 

依赖于语法规则是这种专制方法的本质特征

Some usages are ‘prescribed’, to be learnt and followed accurately; others are ‘<u>proscribed</u>’, to be avoided.

有些语言用法被‘规定’要精确的学习语言；其他用法则被‘禁止’，需要避免。

 In this early period, there were no half-measures: usage was either right or wrong, and it was the task of the grammarian not simply to record alternatives, but to pronounce judgment upon them.

在早期，没有任何宽容可言：语言用法非对即错，这也是语法学家的任务，他们需要在错误用法上做出判断，而不是简单的表示替代用法。

These attitudes are still with us, and they motivate a widespread concern that linguistic standards should be maintained. 

这种态度如今任然存在，他们使得人们广泛关注是否应该维持语言标准

Nevertheless, there is an alternative point of view that is concerned less with standards than with the *facts* of linguistic usage. 

尽管如此，还有另一种更强调于语言的实用性而非其标准观点

This approach is summarized in the statement that it is the task of the grammarian to *describe*, not *prescribe—*to record the facts of linguistic diversity, and not to attempt the impossible tasks of evaluating language <u>variation</u> or halting language change. 

这种方法大体上认为：语法学家的任务是描述，而非规定-记录语言多样性的事实，而不要企图评估语言的变化或阻止语言改变这项不可能的任务

In the second half of the 18th century, we already find advocates of this view, such as Joseph Priestley, whose *Rudiments* of *English Grammar* (1761) insists that ‘the custom of speaking is the original and only just standard of any language’. 

Linguistic issues, it is argued, cannot be solved by logic and legislation.

语言问题是十分具有争议性的，不能简单的用逻辑思维或法律解决。

 And this view has become the tenet of the modern linguistic approach to grammatical analysis.

这个观点已变成现代语言学家进行语法分析的原则。

In our own time, the opposition between ‘descriptivists’ and ‘<u>prescriptivists</u>’ has often become extreme, with both sides painting unreal pictures of the other. 

在如今，‘叙述主义者’和‘规则主义者’之间的冲突常常变得疯狂，双方将对方描绘为不现实的画面

Descriptive grammarians have been presented as people who do not care about standards, because of the way they see all forms of usage as equally valid. 

‘叙述主义者’常常是那些不关心标准，因为他们认为的所有使用形式都同样有效

Prescriptive grammarians have been presented as blind adherents to a historical tradition. 

‘规则主义者’则是那些盲目追寻历史传统的人

The opposition has even been presented in quasi-political terms—of radical liberalism vs elitist conservatism.

这种对立甚至以政治的形式存在-自由主义和保守主义

### **Tidal Power**

*Undersea <u>turbines</u> which produce electricity from the tides are set to become an* *important source of renewable energy for Britain.

*It is still too early to predict the* *extent of the impact they may have, but all the signs are that they will play a* *significant role in the future* 

#### *A.*

Operating on the same principle as wind turbines, the power in sea turbines

*comes from tidal currents which turn blades similar to ships propellers, but, unlike* 

*wind, the tides are predictable and the power input is constant. 

*The technology* *raises the prospect of Britain becoming self-sufficient in renewable energy and* *<u>drastically</u> reducing its carbon dioxide <u>emissions</u>.*

这项技术产生了英国用可再生能源自足和大量减少二氧化碳排放污染的前景。

If tide, wind and wave-power* *are all developed, Britain would be able to close gas, coal and nuclear plants and* *export renewable power to other parts of Europe. 

*Unlike wind power which Britain* *originally developed and then abandoned for 20 years allowing the Dutch to make* *it a major industry, undersea turbines could become a big export earner to island* *nations such as Japan and New Zealand.*

#### *B.*

Tidal sites have already been identified that will produce one sixth or more of the* *UK’s power—and at prices competitive with modern gas turbines and* *<u>undercutting</u> those of the already ailing nuclear industry. 

*One site alone, the* *Pentland Firth, between Orkney and mainland Scotland, could produce 10% of* *the country’s electricity with <u>banks</u> of turbines under the sea, and another at* *Alderney in the Channel Islands three times the 1,2000 megawatts of Britain’s* *largest and newest nuclear plant, Sizewell B, in Suffolk. *

*Other sites identified* *include the Bristol Channel and the west coast of Scotland, particularly the* *channel between Campbelttown and Northern Irealand.*

#### C.

 *Work on designs for the new turbine blades and sites are well advanced at the* *university of Southampton’s sustainable energy research group. *

*The first station* *is expected to be installed off Lynmouth in Devon shortly to test the technology in* a venture jointly funded by the department of Trade and Industry and the* *European Union. *

*AbuBakn Bahaj, in charge of the Southampton research, said:* *‘The prospects for energy from tidal currents are far better than from wind* *because the flows of water are predictable and constant. *

*The technology for* *dealing with the hostile <u>saline</u> environment under the sea has been developed in* *the North Sea oil industry and much is already known about turbine blade design,* *because of wind power and ship propellers. *

*There are a few technical difficulties,* *but I believe in the next five to ten years we will be installing commercial marine* turbine farm. 

Southampton has been rewarded* £215,000 over three years to develop the turbines and is working with Marine Current Turbines, a <u>subsidiary</u> of IT power, on the Lynmouth project.

Southampton经过3年的开发已经被政府奖励了215000欧元，并且正在于IT power的子公司 Marine Current Turbines 合作 Lynmouth 项目.

 EU research has now identified 106 potential sites for tidal power, 80% round the coasts of Britain. 

The best sites are between islands or around heavily <u>indented</u> coasts where there are strong tidal currents.

#### D. 

A marine turbine blade needs to be only one third of the size of a wind generator 

to produce three times as much power. The blades will be about 20 meters in 

diameter, so around 30 meters of water is required. Unlike wind power, there are 

unlikely to be environmental objections. Fish and other creatures are thought 

unlikely to be at risk from the relatively slow-turning blades. Each turbine will be 

mounted on a tower which will connect to the national power supply grid via 

underwater cables. The towers will stick out of the water and be lit, to warn 

shipping, and also be designed to be lifted out of the water for <u>maintenance</u> and 

to clean <u>seaweed</u> from the blades.

#### *E.*

* Dr Bahaj has done most work on the Alderney site, where there are powerful* 

*currents. The single undersea turbine farm would produce far more power than* 

*needed for the Channel Isalands and most would be fed into the French Grid and* 

*be re-imported into Britain via the cable under the Channel.*

#### *F.*

* One technical difficulty is cavitation, where low pressure behind a turning blade* 

*causes air bubbles. These can cause vibration and damage the blades of the* 

*turbines. Dr Bahaj said: ‘We have to test a number of blade types to avoid this* 

*happening or at least make sure it does not damage the turbines or reduce* 

*performance. Another slight concern is submerged debris floating into the blades.* 

*So far we do not know how much of a problem it might be. We will have to make* 

*the turbines <u>robust</u> because the sea is a hostile environment, but all the signs that* 

*we can do it are good.*
