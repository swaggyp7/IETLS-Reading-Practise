The given graph introduces construction of the landfill site, and process of how it works.

In general, it build up with a ditch arounded by amount of natural stones. In addition, the use of it can divide into 2 steps, poul and close.

In terms of it structure. firstly, it demand a man-made hole, and cram rocks around it. After that, clay need to attach on the surface of ditch, and then a synthetic lining stick on the clay, however, it is notable that a drainage tank need to be reserved. Finally, build drainage pipes in the bottom of ditch.

Then we learn about how to use it. To begin with, family disposal are pouled off into ditch by trucks, then the waste will milled by drainage pipes; meanwhile, waste liquid stream into ground through drainage tank. And then cover the hole by using clay. But be attention, it is important to left a small hole and stick a pipe into ditch as some gases may produced by milling waste, it will explode if gases can not leave out.
