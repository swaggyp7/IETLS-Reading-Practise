The maps below show the campus at present and how it will look like in the future.

The given maps introduce the school layout for now and the projection of its change.

Overall, most of the existing buildings will expand, and some new facilities will build up. There is also a new road in the plan, which would facilitate staff parking their car. In addtion, most of the plants areas will reduce as the build of new facilities. I will separate the maps to two areas by top road to introduce the changes.

Looking at the top area of the maps, the plants area which is left on the walkway will reduces and two buildings will situate to here, namely Genetic Building 2 and Bioimaging. And then, the carpark which is right on the walkway will restricts students only.

Then looking at bottom area, it is noticeable that a new road will add between two roads, thus, cross between two paths will become more convenient in the future. Meanwhile, a new carpark will build on the left of the new road, but it is only for staff. And then, the plants area will remove altogether as the expansion of the Biochemistry Building. Finally, on the left of the walkway, Genetic Building and Bio-tech Building will expand.
