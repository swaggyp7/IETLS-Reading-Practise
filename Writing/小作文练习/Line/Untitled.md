The line graphs below show the production of and demand for steel in million tonnes and the number of workers employed in the steel industry in the UK in 2010.

P > D most month of year

Worker decrease in the mass

P and W had similar trend

The given line charts introduce the consumption of and the production of steel, and the number of labors who employed in the steel industry in the UK, in 2010.

Overall, it was evident that the amount of steel produced was higher than the amount of actual consumption in most month of 2010. Meanwhil, the number of labors dropped gradually in the mass in that year.

Speaking of the steel production first, the first season of 2010 experienced fluctuation. After that, it remained stable until July, dropped to about 3000 million tonnes. And then, it peaked at exact 5000 million tonnes. Finally, fell dramatically during the last season of the year, at less than 1000 million tonnes, which was also its lowest point of 2010. In contrast, the demand for steel fluctuated during the three seasons of the year, but it was never over 3000 million tonnes, then dropped rapidly to its lowest point at November, at about 100 million tonnes. However, it rose significantly at December, and surpassed the counterpart of steel production.

As far as the number of labors is concerned, it rose ploddingly at the start of the year, and then dropped rapidly at March. After that, it fluctuated until at August, fell gradaully to its lowest point at December, at approximately 1000 million tonnes.
