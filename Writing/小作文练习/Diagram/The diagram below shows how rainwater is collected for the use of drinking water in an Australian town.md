The given graph introduces the process of collecting rainwater, and how to recycle it to drinking water in an Australian town.

Overall, the recycling of rainwater can be divided into three steps: collecting rainwater, sift and store water, use chemicals to clean water.

Initially, in the first step, their tilted house roofs facilitate rainwater to streams to the drain which attach on the wall of their houses. It is noticeable that there is a large pipe where all houses' drain finally stream to. In addition, it is presumable that the family used water also join the water recycling. After that, dirty water streams to the storage via water filter, which presumably can sift the waste items in the water.

Finally, there is a pipe link between the storage and the water treatment. In terms of the water treatment, there are some chemicals  are sowed into water to decompose the dirty in water. In turn there is a pipe link between water treatment and houses, which pass the clean water to people's home.
