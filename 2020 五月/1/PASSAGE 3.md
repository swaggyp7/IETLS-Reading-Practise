## Driverless cars

Driverless cars may be set to become reality. At least that is, if the <u>executives</u> behind the taxi app, Uber, are to be believed.( 至少，如果出租车APP背后的高管可信的话 ) Currently, Uber is taking its biggest steps yet towards a driver-free world, launching the Uber Advanced Technologies Centre in Pittsburgh.( 现在，优步已经迈入了司机自由世界的巨大一步，在XXX启动了XXX中心 ) The ultimate goal of this institution is to 'do research and development, primarily in the areas of mapping and vehicle safety and autonomy technology'.(该机构的最终目标是为了实现“ 研究和发展自动驾驶技术 ”)

To date, Uber has provided a <u>chauffeur</u>-driven taxi service for American clients.( 如今，优步已经为美国客户提供了chauffeur(司机)驾驶出租车服务 ) Venturing into the realms of driverless cars is <u>therefore</u> a new direction which will require massive investment.( 因此，投资无人驾驶汽车会是一个新方向，会需要大量投资 ) **It is indeed a huge leap of faith on Uber's part, since technology has yet to <u>catch up</u> with the idea of a fully autonomous vehicle.** ( 这确实是优步的一次信仰上的跳跃，因为技术还没赶上全自动驾驶汽车的想法 )On the <u>*as well as*</u> stay in <u>lane</u>, and maintain a steady cruising seed.( 行驶在路上以及停留在路上，维护稳定的巡航种子 ) **In a patchwork fashion such cars could eventually build up to almost full automation** and Uber believes that car owners will readily embrace the idea of driverless taxis.( 以缝合的方式，这些车最终可以实现全自动驾驶，优步也相信车主们会乐意的拥抱自动驾驶出租车的想法 ) In Uber's eyes, current car owners only **stand to gain** by the introduction of such technology.( 优步认为，现在的车主只会从这项技术的引入中获利) Hiring a driverless cab means that the client does not have to pay for the cost of the driver in the cab fee. The only cost incurred by clients is for fuel, plus wear and tear.( 叫自动驾驶不需要给司机费用，唯一的会产生费用的地方就是燃油，磨损 ) It is certainly an attractive <u>proposition</u>.( 这毫无疑问是个吸引人的提议 ) Uber stands to benefit, too, since employees currently working as taxi drivers will be removed from the company's <u>payroll</u>.( 优步也会获益，因为现在的雇佣的司机将会被从工资名单溢出 ) Apparently for car drivers and Uber, it is a win-win situation. ( 显而易见对于司机和优步来说，这是双赢 )

Not everyone will benefit however from this technology, the car industry being an obvious example. ( 当然不是所有人都能从这项科技获益，车制造业是一个明显的例子 )Not surprisingly, the industry views the concept of selt-driving cars with a sense of growing alarm.( 不令人奇怪，汽车行业将这项技术的概念越来越警觉 ) Such technology could well prove the death <u>knell</u> for private car ownership.( 这项技术很可能给个人汽车拥有者们敲响了丧钟 ) **As a result, the industry is dragging its feet over the / manufacture and / introduction of / fully automated vehicles onto the market, due to commercial issues.** ( 作为结果，汽车行业很难将全自动驾驶汽车的引入市场和生产，因为商业原因 )

The commercial aspect apart, there is also the safety issue.( 抛开商业方面，也存在安全问题 ) Whilst a fully automated car could respond to most eventualities in the course of a trip, would it be capable of responding to unforeseen events, such as changes in route or unexpected diversions?( 尽管自动驾驶汽车可以对路途中大多紧急情况作出反应，但它是否具有避免意外如突然的变道和意外的偏离的能力？ ) Evidently legislative authorities are also of this opinion.( 明显立法机构也对此表示疑问 ) Currently, no matter how much automation a car has, it still requires a driver with a full licence behind the wheel to drive on public roads.( 不论现在车子现在有多智能，但仍然需要一个持证司机控制其在路上行驶 ) Whilst robot drivers, on the whole, have the upper hand on their human counterparts safety-wise, that still does not guarantee that they will become legal( 尽管全自动驾驶具有更高的安全性，但法律还是不允许其在马路上行驶 ). **As a <u>consortium</u> of researchers put it, 'I self-driving cars cut the roughly 40,000 annual US traffic fatalities in half, the car mbelikeakers might get not 20,000 thank-you notes, but 20,000 lawsuits.'**( 就像研究人员联盟说的：我的自动驾驶汽车，每年能将美国大约40000起的致命交通事故减半，汽车制造厂可能不会收到20000封感谢信，而是20000张法律传票 )

**Interestingly, Uber are now undertaking an aggressive hiring <u>campaign</u> / for taxi drivers to <u>meet</u> the <u>demand</u>  /for their taxi app.**( 有趣的是，优步现在正在大量雇佣的士司机以满足他们APP的需求 ) It seems that even Uber is less than confident that driverless taxis will soon become a reality.( 看起来优步对无人驾驶技术很快会到来没有信心 ) **Whether Uber is <u>backing</u> a <u>doomed</u> campaign or instead is about to bring in a technology that will be universally greeted with positivity and acceptance depends entirely on your viewpoint.**( 无论优步是在做一项注定失败的任务，或是引入一项会被普遍幸然接受的科技，都取决于你的看法 )

John Reynolds, a Pittsburgh taxi driver, is angry at Uber's attitude on fully automated technology.( XXX,的士司机，他对优步对自动驾驶技术的态度很生气 ) 'They are completely disregarding individual livelihoods, such as mine, as well as those of big car manufacturers in the pursuit of money.( 他们完全无视我们每个人的生计，比如我的，也无视每个为钱而奋斗的汽车厂商 ) Admittedly things change and we have to roll with the times, but there should be some safeguards in place to protect those potentially affected by the introduction of new technologies.( 确实，事情发生变化时我们必须也随之前进，但对于可能被新科技影响的人们应该有某种保护 ) I guess I'm <u>biased</u>, being a taxi driver myself, but it's difficult to see it objectively.'( 我作为的士司机，可能确实存在一定偏见，但真的很难客观的看待这件事 )

Susie Greenacre, a resident of Pittsburgh, has no such reservations about driverless cars.( XXX，XX的居民，对无人驾驶汽车毫无保留的支持 ) 'I'm all for it. Driverless cars have my backing, any day!( 我完全赞成！任何时候我都支持无人驾驶技术！ ) I hate the stress of rush-hour traffic| I think if I could just hop in a driverless car which would take me anywhere I wanted I would never want to drive again!' ( 我讨厌堵车，我想如果我能跳入能带我去任何地方的无人驾驶车中，我再也不会开车了！ )

Jason Steiner, a school teacher in a Pittsburgh secondary school, is <u>inclined</u> to agree with Susie.( XXX,XXX学校的老师，倾向于Susie的观点 ) 'Whilst I'm not <u>averse</u> to driving, I would swap the stressful daily commute by car to a driverless one if I had the chance! It just takes the pressure off driving. I would be slightly <u>wary</u> though, of completely dependent on a robot-driven car when it comes to having to react to unexpected obstacles in the road.'( 虽然我不讨厌开车，但如果可以我还是会把烦人的每日同寝交给自动驾驶汽车, 这可以减轻驾驶压力，虽然当紧急情况发生时，把自己的性命完全交给自动驾驶会令人担心 )
