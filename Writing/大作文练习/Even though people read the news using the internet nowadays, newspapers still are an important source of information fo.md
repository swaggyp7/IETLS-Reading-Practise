Even though people read the news using the internet nowadays, newspapers still are an important source of information for the general public/the majority of people. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?

As the development of techinology, more and more people read the news using the internet, it almost take the place of legacy newspaper. however, there are some people believe that the newspapers still are an important source of information for the majority of people, I completely disagree with that point.

Speaking of the newspaper first, it is certainly preferred by some old people who can not use the mobile phone or computer, however, it can not be the mainstream. Because it is inconvenient for the majority of the people, such as worker or students, it is impossible to read the newspaper on the subway or bus. In addition, newspaper easy to outmoded if you do not go to buy a new one at every morning. Thus, nowadays, newspaper is not suitable for majority of people.

However, read the news paper using internet can solve all disadvatages of legacy newspaper. It is more convenient and portable, people would rather reading the news by tapping their mobile phone than go to buy a newspaper before their commute everyday. Thanks to the internet, we can always get first hand news from it and never worry about whether it has been obsoleted as it could up-to-date automatically. People have no reason to read the legacy newspaper if they could using any devices which could connect to the internet.

To sum up, I  think the newspaper is not the public choice, the internet already took it place as its variety of advantages, so, it is time to let legacy newspaper out off the stage.
