## GRAFFITI

**A**

The word ‘graffiti’ derives from the Greek word <u>graphein</u>, meaning to write.( "涂鸦"这个词，源于希腊词：graphein(石墨烯), 意思是写） This evolved into the Latin word graffito.（ 进化为拉丁语中的‘graffito’ ） Graffiti is the <u>plural</u> form of graffito.( Graffiti 是 graffito的复数形式 ) Simply put, graffiti is a drawing, scribbling or writing on a flat surface.( 简而言之，涂鸦指的是在宽大的表面上绘图，写字 ) Today, we equate graffiti with the ‘New York’ or ‘Hip Hop’ style which emerged from New York City in the 1970s.( 今天，我们常常将涂鸦与于在1970年纽约市出现的''嘻哈音乐''和''纽约''联系在一起 ) Hip Hop was originally an inner-city concept.( 嘻哈音乐最初是市中心的概念 ) It evolved from the rap music made in Brooklyn and Harlem in the late 1960s and early 1970s.( 他从1960年-1970年在布鲁克林和哈莱姆出现的饶舌音乐演变而来 ) Donald Clarke, a music historian, has written that rap music was a reaction to the disco music of the period.( Donald Clarke，一位音乐历史学家，他写道，饶舌音乐是对那个时期的迪斯科英语的响应 ) Disco was centred in the rich, elitist clubs of Manhattan and rap emerged on street corners as an alternative.( 迪斯科属于富裕的曼哈顿精英俱乐部，而饶舌音乐则出现在街头作为取代 ) Using <u>lyrical</u> rhythms and ‘beat boxing’, the music was a way to express feelings about <u>inner-city</u> life.( 通过抒情的韵律和节拍，这种英语是表达市中心生活感受的一种方式 ) **Hip Hop emerged as <u>turntables</u> began to be used to form part of the rhythm by ‘<u>scratching</u>’ (the sound created by running the <u>stylus</u> over the <u>grooves</u> of an <u>LP</u>)**.( 嘻哈出现是因为播放机转盘开始用于通过摩擦（ 这种声音由与指针与光碟摩擦产生产生 ）形成部分的韵律 ) **As Hip Hop music emerged so did a new <u>outlet</u> for artistic visibility.**( 随着嘻哈音乐的出现使得艺术能见度有了新的宣泄口) Keith Haring began using <u>posters</u> to place his uniquely drawn <u>figures</u> and characters in public places.( Keith Haring 将他唯一的人物形象画在海报上，并贴在公共场所 ) Soon he began to draw directly on subway walls and <u>transit</u> posters.( 很快他开始直接画在地铁的墙上和公交海报上 ) The uniqueness of his drawings eventually led to their being shown in galleries and published in books and his art became ‘legitimate’.( 他的画作的独特性最终使它们出现在展览馆和发行在书中，并且他的艺术逐渐变的‘合法’)

**B**

At about the same time as Keith Haring, a delivery messenger began writing ‘Taki 183’ whenever he delivered documents.( 在Keith Haring的同一时期，有一位邮递员开始在他送件时写上‘Taki 183’ ) Soon his name was all over the city.( 很快他的名字让大众所知 ) Newspapers and magazines wrote articles about him and Keith Haring, and soon both became celebrities.( 新闻和杂志很快发行了关于他们的文章，使他们很快都成为饿了名人 ) This <u>claim to fame</u> attracted many young people, especially those involved with rapping, and they began to imitate ‘Taki 183’, as a means to indicate the writer’s presence, i.e. the age old statement of I was here.( 这一声望吸引了许多年轻人，特别是与嘻哈有关的，他们开始模仿 ‘Taki 183’，以这种方式表达作家的存在, 例如: 我生活在这古老的陈述  )Graffiti was soon incorporated into the Hip Hop culture and became a sort of <u>triad</u> with rapping and breakdancing.( 涂鸦很快融入到嘻哈文化中，并和街舞和说唱形成三人组 ) **Breakdancing has since lost much of its initial popularity, while rapping has emerged as a major style in American music**.( 从此, 嘻哈作为美国音乐主流风格，街舞开始变得不那么流行 ) New York City was <u>inundated</u> with graffiti during the late seventies and early eighties, but as media <u>coverage</u> faded so did the graffiti.( 在70年代后期至80年代早期，纽约布满了涂鸦，但当媒体报道逐渐变少，涂鸦也变得不那么流行了 ) Then, in the mid-eighties a national TV programme did a graffiti story and <u>set off</u> a graffiti wildfire which has since gone global.( 然后，80年代中期一个全国性的电视节目制作了涂鸦的故事并使得涂鸦开始向全球广泛传播 )

**C**

**In the past, graffiti artists usually worked alone, but the size and complexity of pieces as well as safety concerns motivated artists to work together in crews, which are groups of graffitists that vary in membership from 3 to 10 or more persons**.( 在过去，涂鸦艺术家总是一个人工作，但涂鸦大小和图案的复杂性，以及对安全的考虑，使得涂鸦艺术家们开始组建3-10人的团队一起工作。 ) A member of a crew can be ‘down with’ (affiliated with) more than one crew.( 一个组员可以隶属于多个组 ) To join a crew, one must have produced <u>stylish</u> pieces and show potential for developing one’s own, unique style.( 想要加入涂鸦团队，必须创造过高水平的涂鸦，并且需要展示自己能够创作唯一风格的潜能 ) A crew is headed by a king or queen who is usually that person recognised as having the best artistic ability among the members of the crew.( 涂鸦组由组里公认艺术水平最强的组员担任，常常被称为皇帝或皇后 ) One early crew wrote TAG as their crew name, an <u>acronym</u> for Tuff Artists Group.( 一个早期的涂鸦组织将他们的组织命名为‘TAG’ - Tuff Artists Group的缩写 ) Tag has since come to mean both graffiti writing, ‘tagging’ and graffiti, a ‘tag’.( 从此tag这个词也被用来形容涂鸦 ) Crews often tag together, writing both the crew tag and their own personal tags.( 组员们常常一起涂鸦，既画组里的涂鸦，也会画他们私人的涂鸦 ) Graffiti has its own language with terms such as: piece, toy, wild-style, and racking.(涂鸦有它自己的术语，例如：piece, toy, wild-style, and racking)

At first pens and markers were used, but these were limited as to what types of surfaces they worked on, so very quickly everyone started using <u>spray</u> paint.( 起初，他们使用记号笔和钢笔涂鸦，但这两种笔对涂鸦表面有大的限制，所以很快他们开始使用喷绘 ) Spray paint could mark all types of surfaces and was quick and easy to use.( 喷绘可以在任何表面上快速绘画，而且易于使用) However, the spray nozzles on the spray cans proved inadequate to create the more colourful pieces.( 然而，喷罐上的喷嘴被证为不足以创作鲜艳的画作) Caps from <u>deodorant</u>, <u>insecticide</u>, and other <u>aerosol</u> cans were substituted to allow for a finer or thicker stream of paint.( 除臭剂，消毒剂和其他喷雾器的盖子被用来替代，以提供更好更浓厚的液体用来喷绘) As municipalities began passing graffiti <u>ordinances</u> outlawing graffiti implements, clever ways of disguising paint implements were devised.( 当政府通过涂鸦法令，将涂鸦行为归位非法行为时，一种聪明的伪装绘画的方式被发明出来) Shoe polish, <u>deodorant</u> roll-ons and other seemingly innocent containers were emptied and filled with paint.(鞋刷，走珠式除臭剂和其他看起来合法的容器被置空并装满颜料) Markers, art pens and grease pens obtained from art supply stores were also used.( 记号笔，从艺术补给品商店取得的艺术笔和油脂笔也被用来涂鸦) In fact, nearly any object which can leave a mark on most surfaces is used by taggers, though the spray can is the medium of choice for most taggers.( 事实上，几乎任何能在大部分表面留下记号的物品都被涂鸦者使用，虽然大部分涂鸦者都适用喷瓶作为容器)

**E**

As graffiti has grown, <u>so too has</u> its character.( 随着涂鸦的发展，它的特性也随之丰富) What began as an urban lower-income protest, graffiti now spans all racial and economic groups.( 涂鸦从一开始流行于低收入抗议者群体，现在已经成为跨越人种和阶级的艺术) While many inner-city kids are still heavily involved in the graffiti culture, taggers range from the ultra-rich to the ultra-poor. ( 尽管许多贫民窟儿童与涂鸦还是有着深厚的关系，但涂鸦者的群体横跨了极穷到极富的阶层)There is no general classification of graffitists.( 涂鸦者没有一般的分类，什么人都有) They range in age from 12-30 years old, and there are male and female artists.( 他们是12-30岁年纪的男或女艺术家) One tagger recently caught in Philadelphia was a 27-year-old stockbroker who drove to tagging sites in his BMW.( 一个27岁的股票经纪人最近开着他的宝马去涂鸦点时被曝光) Styles have dramatically evolved from the simple <u>cursory</u> style, which is still the most prevalent, to <u>intricate</u> <u>interlocking</u> letter graphic designs with multiple colours called ‘pieces’ (from masterpieces).( 涂鸦风格戏剧性的从如今仍然流行的潦草风格，演变成环环相扣，错综复杂的多色彩字母图案组合，称为'pieces'(源于‘杰作’)) **Gang markings of territory also <u>fit</u> the definition of graffiti, and they mainly consist of tags and messages that provide ‘news’ of happenings in the neighbourhood.**( 地区帮派标记也与涂鸦的定义相称，他们主要由包含社区的’新鲜事儿’的涂鸦和信息构成)

**F**

Graffiti shops, both retail and on-line, sell a wide variety of items to taggers.( 线上和线下的涂鸦商店给涂鸦者们售卖各种各样的涂鸦用品) Caps, markers, magazines, T-shirts, backpacks, shorts with hidden pockets, even drawing books with templates of different railroad cars can be purchased.( 帽子，记号笔，杂志，T恤，隐藏口袋的短裤，甚至各种各样的火车绘画书都可以在网站上订购) Over 25,000 graffiti sites exist on the world wide web;( 互联网中有超过25000个涂鸦站) the majority of these are pro-graffiti.( 大部分都是职业涂鸦用品x) Graffiti <u>vandalism</u> is a problem in nearly every urban area in the world.( 在全世界城市区域几乎都存在涂鸦被随意破坏的问题) Prograffiti web sites post photos of graffiti from Europe, South America, the Philippines, Australia, South Africa, China and Japan.( 世界各地的涂鸦照片被上传到涂鸦网站) Billions of dollars worldwide are spent each year in an effort to curb graffiti.( 全世界每年花费数十亿美元到控制涂鸦上使用)

While most taggers are simply interested in seeing their name in as many places as possible and as visibly as possible, some taggers are more content to find secluded warehouse walls where they can practise their pieces. Some of these taggers are able to sell twelve-foot canvases of their work for upwards of $10 - $12,000. As graffiti was introduced to the art world, two trends happened. One, the art world of collectors, dealers, curators, artists and the like helped graffitists evolve in style, presumably by sharing their artistic knowledge with the newcomers. Two, the exposure helped to expand graffiti into all parts of the world. Furthermore, more progressive cities have recognised the talent of graffitists by providing a means for them to do legal graffiti art, which has helped to foster the art form and lessen the amount of graffiti art that appears in the city as vandalism. Likewise, organisations who support graffiti artists seek out places to do legal graffiti such as abandoned buildings, businesses, or community walls in parks. What this shows is that some graffiti, particularly in the form of spraycan art, is recognised as art by the conventional art world.
