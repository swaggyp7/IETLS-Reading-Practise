**William Henry Perkin**

**The man who invented synthetic dyes**

William Henry Perkin was born on March 12, 1838, in London, England. 

William Henry Perkin 在1838年3月12日生于英国伦敦

As a boy, Perkin’s curiosity prompted early interests in the arts, sciences, photography, 

and engineering. 

当他还是个孩子时，他的好奇心使他对艺术，科学，照片和开发很感兴趣

**But it was a chance stumbling upon a <u>run-down</u>, yet functional,** 

laboratory in his late grandfather’s home that solidified the young man’s enthusiasm 

for chemistry.

但因为一个偶然的机会，他在他已故祖父的家中发现了一个破旧但仍能使用的实验室，这个实验室给这个年轻人对化学的热情打下坚实的基础

As a student at the city of London School, Perkin became <u>immersed</u> in the study at chemistry.

当他在伦敦上学时，他沉浸在化学研究

 His talent and devotion to the subject were perceived by his teachers, 

Thomas Hall, who encouraged him to attend a series of lectures given by the eminent 

scientist Michael Faraday at the Royal Institution. 

他的老师意识到了他的天赋与付出，鼓励他参与著名科学家在皇家教育机构开展的一系列讲座

Those speeches fired the young chemistry’s enthusiasm further, and he later went on to attend the Royal College of 

Chemistry, which he succeeded in entering in 1853, at the age of 15.

这些演讲进一步点燃了这个年轻人对化学的兴趣，使得他之后参加皇家化学学院，并在1853年，他15岁时毕业

At the time of Perkin’s enrolment, the Royal College of Chemistry was headed 

by the noted German chemist August Wilhelm Hofmann.

在他入学时，皇家化学学院的校长是著名的德国化学家August Wilhelm Hofmann.

 Perkin’s scientific gifts soon caught Hofmann’s attention and, within two years, he became Hofmann’s youngest 

assistant. 

Perkin的化学天赋很快引起了他的注意，并在两年内成为了他最年轻的助理

Not long after that, Perkin made the scientific <u>breakthrough</u> that would bring him both fame and fortune

不久后，Perkin创造了科学上的突破，给他带来了名声和运气

At the time, quinine was the only viable medical treatment for malaria.

在那时，quinine是疟疾的唯一治疗手段

 The drug is derived from the bark of the cinchona tree, native to South America, and by 1856, 

这种药物源于Cinchona树皮，在1856年原产于南非

demand for the drug was <u>surpassing</u> the available supply. 

但是这种药物供不应求

Thus, when Hofmann made some <u>passing</u> comments about the desirability of a synthetic substitute for 

quinine, it was unsurprising that his star <u>pupil</u> was moved to take up the challenge.

因此，当Hofmann偶然提及到对急需quinine合成替代物时，他的明星弟子开始了这项挑战也不足为奇

During his vacation in 1856, Perkin spent his time in the laboratory on the top floor of 

his family’s house. 

在他1856年的假期时，Perkin整天呆在他祖父家楼顶的实验室中

He was attempting to manufacture quinine from aniline, an inexpensive and readily available coal tar waste product.

他企图用廉价且可轻易从煤炭废料中获取的aniline量产quinine

 Despite his best efforts, however, he did not end up with quinine. 

尽管他付出了巨大的努力，然而他并没有成功造出quinine

Instead, he produced a mysterious dark <u>sludge</u>. Luckily, Perkin’s scientific training and nature prompted him to investigate the substance further. 

但是，他产出了一种神秘的黑色淤泥，幸运的是，Perkin的科学素养和求知本性促使他进一步调查这个物质

Incorporating potassium dichromate and alcohol into the aniline at various stages of the experimental process, he finally produced a deep purple solution.

在实验过程中的多个阶段分别将potassium dichromate 和酒精融入aniline中，他最终得到了深紫色溶剂

 And, proving the truth of the famous scientist Louis Pasteur’s words ‘chance favours only the prepared mind’, Perkin saw the potential of his unexpected find.

因此，证明了著名科学家Louis Pasteur的话‘机会只给有准备的人’，Perkin看见了他意外发现物质的潜力

Historically, textile dyes were made from such natural sources as plants and animal 

<u>excretions</u>. 

从历史上来看，丝绸燃料常常用天然资源作为原材料，例如植物和动物粪便

Some of these, such as the <u>glandular mucus of snails</u>, were difficult to 

obtain and outrageously expensive.

这些大多都很难获取，并且贵的离谱,例如glandular mucus of snails（不影响阅读）

 Indeed, the purple colour extracted from a snail was once so costly that in society at the time only the rich could afford it.

确实，从snail中提取的紫色非常昂贵，以至于社会中只有贵族阶层能负担得起

 Further, natural dyes tend to be muddy in hue and fade quickly.

此外，天然染料常常变得浑浊且很快褪色

 It was against this <u>backdrop</u> that Perkin’s discovery was made.

Perkin quickly grasped that his purple solution could be used to colour fabric, 

thus making it the world’s first synthetic dye. Realising the importance of this 

breakthrough, he lost no time in patenting it. But perhaps the most fascinating of all 

Perkin’s reactions to his find was his nearly instant recognition that the new dye had 

commercial possibilities.

Perkin originally named his dye Tyrian Purple, but it later became commonly 

known as mauve (from the French for the plant used to make the colour violet). He 

asked advice of Scottish dye works owner Robert Pullar, who assured him that 

manufacturing the dye would be well worth it if the colour remained fast (i.e. would not 

fade) and the cost was relatively low. So, over the fierce objections of his mentor 

Hofmann, he left college to give birth to the modern chemical industry.

With the help of his father and brother, Perkin set up a factory not far from 

London. Utilising the cheap and plentiful coal tar that was an almost unlimited 

byproduct of London’s gas street lighting, the dye works began producing the world’s 

first synthetically dyed material in 1857. The company received a commercial boost 

from the Empress Eugenie of France, when she decided the new colour flattered her. 

Very soon, Mauve was the necessary shade for all the fashionable ladies in that 

country. Not to be outdone, England’s Queen Victoria also appeared in public wearing 

a mauve gown, thus making it all the rate in England as well. The dye was bold and 

fast, and the public clamoured for more. Perkin went back to the drawing board.

Although Perkin’s fame was achieved and fortune assured by his first discovery, 

the chemist continued his research. Among other dyes he developed and introduced 

were aniline red (1859) and aniline black (1863) and, in the late 1860s, Perkin’s synthetic dye 

discoveries had outcomes far beyond the merely decorative. The dyes 

also became vital to medical research in many ways. For instance, they were used to 

stain previously invisible microbes and bacteria, allowing researchers to identify such 

bacilli as tuberculosis, cholera, and anthrax. Artificial dyes continue to play a crucial 

role today. And, in what would have been particularly pleasing to Perkin, their current 

use is in the search for a vaccine against malaria.

**IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE?**

**The Search for Extra-terrestrial Intelligence**

*The question of whether we are alone in the Universe has haunted humanity for* 

*centuries, but we may now stand poised on the brick of the answer to that question,* 

*as the search for radio signals from other intelligent civilizations. This search, often* 

*known by the acronym SETI (search for extra-terrestrial intelligence), is a difficult one.* 

*Although groups around the world have been searching intermittently for three* 

*decades, it is only now that we have reached the level of technology where we can* 

*make a determined attempt to search all nearby stars for any sign of life.*

**A** 

The primary reason for the search is basic curiosity—the same curiosity about the 

natural world that drives all pure science. We want to know whether life evolves 

naturally if given the right conditions, or whether there is something very special about

the Earth to have fostered the variety of life forms that we see around us on the planet. 

The simple detection of a radio signal will be sufficient to answer this most basic of all 

the questions. In this sense, SETI is another cog in the machinery of pure science 

which is continually pushing out the horizon of our knowledge. However, there are 

other reasons for being interested in whether life exists elsewhere. For example, we 

have had civilization on Earth for perhaps only a few thousand years, and the threats 

of the nuclear war and pollution over the last few decades have told us that our 

survival may be tenuous. Will we last another two thousand years or will we wipe 

ourselves out? Since the lifetime of a planet like outs is several billion years, we can

expect that, if other civilizations do survive in our galaxy, their ages will range from 

zero to several billion years. Thus any mere existence of such a civilization will tell us 

that long-term survival is possible, and gives us some cause for optimism. It is even 

possible that the older civilization may pass on the benefits of their experience in 

dealing with threats to survival such as nuclear war and global pollution, and other 

threats that we haven’t yet discovered.

**B**

In discussing whether we are alone, most SETI scientists adopt two ground rules. 

First, UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) are generally ignored since most scientists 

don’t consider the evidence for them to be strong enough to bear serious 

consideration although it is also important to keep an open mind in case any really 

convincing evidence emerges in the future. Second, we make a very conservative 

assumption that we are looking for a life form that is pretty well like us, since if it 

differs radically from us we may well not recognize it as a life form, quite apart from 

whether we are able to communicate with it. In other words, the life form we are 

looking for may well have two green heads and seven fingers, but it will nevertheless 

resemble us in that it should communicate with its fellows, be interested in the 

Universe, live on a planet orbiting a star like our Sun, and perhaps most restrictively, 

have a chemistry, like us, based on carbon and water.

**C**

Even when we make these assumptions, our understanding of other life forms is still 

severely limited. We do not even know, for example, how many stars have planets, 

and we certainly do not know how likely it is that life will arise naturally, given the right 

conditions. However, when we look at the 100 billion stars in our galaxy (the milky 

way), and 100 billion galaxies in the observable Universe, it seems inconceivable that 

at least one of these planets does not have a life form on it: in fact, the best educated 

guess we can make, using the little we do know about the conditions for 

carbon-based life, leads us to estimate that perhaps one in 100,000 stars might have 

a life-bearing planet orbiting it. That means that our nearest neighbours are perhaps 

100 light years away, which is almost next door in astronomical terms.

**D**

An alien civilization could choose many different ways of sending information across 

the galaxy, but many of these either require too much energy, or else are severely 

attenuated while traversing the vast distances across the galaxy. It turns out that, for 

a given amount of transmitted power, radio waves in the frequency range 1000 to 

3000 MHz travel the greatest distance, and so all searches to date have concentrated 

on looking for radio waves in this frequency range. So far there have been a number 

of searches by various groups around the world, including Australian searches using 

the radio telescope at Parkes, New South Wales. Until now there have not been any 

detections from the few hundred stars which have been searched. The scale of the 

searches has been increased dramatically since 1992, when the US Congress NASA 

110 million per year for ten years to conduct a thorough search for extra terrestrial life. 

Much of the money in this project is being spent on the developing the special 

hardware needed to search many frequencies at once. The project has two parts. 

One part is a targeted search using the world’s largest radio telescopes, the 

America-operated telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico and the French telescope in 

Nancy in France. This part of the project is searching the nearest 1000 likely stars 

with high sensitivity for signals in the frequency range 1000 to 3000 MHz. The other 

part of the project is an undirected search which is monitoring all of space with a 

lower sensitivity, using the smaller antennas of NASA’s Deep Space Network.

**E**

There is considerable debate over how we should react if we detect a signal from an 

alien civilization. Everybody agrees that we should not reply immediately. Quite apart 

from the impracticality of sending a reply over such large distances at short notice, it 

raises a host of ethical questions that would have to be addressed by the global 

community before any reply could be sent. Would the human race face the culture 

shock if faced with a superior and much older civilization? Luckily, there is no urgency 

about this. The stars being searched are hundreds of light years away, so it takes 

hundreds of years for their signal to reach us, and a further few hundreds for our reply 

to reach them. It’s not important, then, if there’s a delay of a few years, or decades. 

While the human race debates the question of whether to reply, and perhaps carefully 

drafts a reply.

**The history of the tortoise**

If you go back far enough, everything lived in the sea. At various points in 

evolutionary history, enterprising individuals within many different animal groups 

moved out onto the land, sometimes even to the most parched deserts, taking their 

own private seawater with them in blood and cellular fluids. In addition to the reptiles, 

birds, mammals and insects which we see all around us, other groups that have 

succeeded out of water include scorpions, snails, crustaceans such as woodlice and 

land crabs, millipedes and centipedes, spider and various worms. And we mustn’t 

forget the plants, without those prior invasion of the land none of the other migrations 

could have happened.

Moving from water to land involved a major redesign of every aspect of life, 

including breathing and reproduction. Nevertheless, a good number of thoroughgoing 

land animals later turned around, abandoned their hard-earned terrestrial re-tooling, 

and returned to the water again. Seals have only gone part way back. They show us 

what the intermediates might have been like, on the way to extreme cases such as 

whales and dugongs. Whales (including the small whales we call dolphins) and 

dugongs, with their close cousins the manatees, ceased to be land creatures 

altogether and reverted to the full marine habits of their remote ancestors. They don’t 

even come ashore to breed. They do, however, still breathe air, having never 

developed anything equivalent to the gills of their earlier marine incarnation. Turtles 

went back to the sea a very long time ago and, like all vertebrate returnees to the 

water, they breath air. However, they are, in one respect, less fully given back to the 

water than whales or dugongs, for turtles still lay their eggs on beaches.

There is evidence that all modern turtles are descended from a terrestrial 

ancestor which lived before most of the dinosaurs. There are two key fossils called 

*Proganochleys quenstedti and Palaeochersis talampayensis* dating from early 

dinousaur times, which appear to be close to the ancestry of all modern turtles and 

tortoises. You might wonder how we can tell whether fossil animal lived on land or in 

water, especially if only fragments are found. Sometimes it’s obvious. Ichthyosaurs 

were reptilian contemporaries of the dinosaurs, with fins and streamlined bodies. The 

fossils look like dolphins, in the water. With turtles it is a little less obvious. One way to 

tell is by measuring the bones of their forelimbs.

Walter Joyce and Jacques Gauthier, at Yale University, obtained three 

measurements in these particular bones of 71 species of living turtles and tortoises. 

They used a kind of triangular graph paper to plot the three measurements against 

one another. All the land tortoise species formed a tight cluster of points in the upper 

part of the triangle; all the water turtles cluster in the lower part of the triangular graph. 

There was no overlap except when they added some species that spend time both in 

water and on land. Sure enough, these amphibious species show up on the triangular 

graph approximately half way between the ‘wet cluster’ of land tortoises. The next 

step was to determine where the fossils fell. The bones of *P. quenstedti* and *P.* 

*talampayensis* leave us in no doubt. Their points on the graph are right in the thick of 

the dry cluster. Both these fossils were dry-land tortoises. They come from the extra 

before our turtles returned to the water.

You might think, therefore, that modern land tortoises have probably stayed on 

land ever since those early terrestrial times, as most mammals did after a few of them 

went back to the sea. But apparently not. If you draw out the family tree of all modern 

turtles and tortoises, nearly all the branches are aquatic. Today’s land tortoises 

constitute a single branch, deeply nested among branches consisting of aquatic 

turtles. This suggests that modern land tortoises have not stayed on land 

continuously since the time of *P. quenstedti* and *P. talampayensis.* Rather, their 

ancestors were among those who went back to the water, and they then re-emerged 

back onto the land in (relatively) more recent times.

Tortoises therefore represent a remarkable double return. In common with all 

mammals, reptiles and birds, their remote ancestors were marine fish and before that 

various more or less worm-like creatures stretching back, still in the sea, to the 

primeval bacteria. Later ancestors lived on land and stayed there for a very large 

number of generations. Later ancestors still evolved back into the water and became 

sea turtles. And finally they returned yet again to the land as tortoises, some of which 

now live in the driest of deserts
