## UNCOVERING THE TRUTH ABOUT GERMANY'S AUTOBAHNS

**A**

Officially the Bundesautobahnen, which, when translated, means federal expressways, we know them more commonly as the autobahns - Germany's impressive system of motorways.( Bundesautobahnen,译为联邦高速公路，我们普遍称为autobahns-令人难以置信的德国高速公路系统 ) **There is nothing extraordinary about them, fine feats of engineering though they may be, so why has the term autobahn become so well known?**( 虽然它们可能是工程上的功绩，但并没有什么非凡的地方，可为什么它们还是如此出名呢？ ) **The simple answer is that people living outside of Germany have had their curiosity more than a little <u>tickled</u> on account of the fact that Germany's motorways are, in one specific way, very unique indeed.** ( 答案很简单，生活在德国外的人们对德国高速公路十分好奇，因为其某些方面确实非常独特 ) They are <span style="color: #a80018">not</span> the longest system in the world, this <u>plaudit</u> going to the <u>Interstate</u> Highway System of America,<span style="color: #a80018"> **nor are they even second or third (China and India respectively), and though they come a healthy fourth in the length stakes, this is really neither here nor there**</span>. ( 德国高速公路不是世界上最长的公路系统，这个称号属于美国洲际高速，甚至连第二或第三都排不上（ 分别是中国和印度 ），尽管它的长度排第四，但这真的不重要 )No, indeed, what fascinates us about the autobahns has nothing to do with their technical or design features.( （这个No应该是呼应前文的不重要，所以翻译成是的）是的，确实，德国高速公路吸引我们的并不是他所使用的技术或设计特色 ) It is though, a lot to do with how fast you can go on them. ( 尽管如此，需要做的事情取决于你要在上面行驶多快 )The autobahns, you see, are the only stretch of motorway in the world on which you can drive your car (provided it is not towing a trailer) at, well, any speed you like.( 你看，德国高速公路唯一的区别就是你可以在上面想开多快开多快 ) Now that's a very attractive proposition for many boy-racers out there who would salivate at the prospect of being able to drive as fast as they wanted, and, therefore, on that rather scary point, perhaps we should consider asking the, well, obvious question: what on earth were the Germans thinking when they did this? Surely having no speed limit whatsoever is a recipe for disaster.( 这是一个非常吸引力的提议，对于那些想在路上狂飙的年轻赛车手们，所以，对于这一点，我们或许该考虑问一个显而易见的问题：德国人的脑子里在想什么？不限速肯定会引发许多灾难 )

**B**

To clarify, there is a 'recommended' speed limit of 130km/h on all stretches of German motorway, and a hard limit is <u>imposed</u> on some vehicles.( 澄清一下，德国高速公路的所有段落都有“推荐”速度，130km/h，而且对某些车辆也有强制限速 ) Buses carrying standing passengers and motorbikes pulling trailers cannot go faster than 60 km/h.( 载有站立乘客的公交车和拉拖车的摩托车不能超过60km/h ) All other buses, as well as passenger cars and trucks with trailers, and all vehicles weighing in excess of 3.5 tonnes are not allowed to exceed 80km/h. （ 所有其他巴士，或载人客车，拖车卡车，和超过3.5ton重量的车辆都不允许超过80km/h ）Rare exceptions include buses that have been officially certified to travel at 100km/h and passenger cars carrying trailers that have received similar certification.( 个别持官方认证的载人巴士可以达到100km/h ) Nonetheless, the fact remains that all other cars, trucks, and motorbikes, while encouraged to adhere to the 'recommended' speed limit, are by no means bound to it and can, in effect, travel as fast as they please. Indeed, many of them do and it is not uncommon to see a car racing past you on the autobahn travelling in excess of 140km/h.( 尽管如此，这就意味着剩下的所有车辆，都鼓励遵守推荐速度行驶，但不是强制限制 )

In such circumstances, it would not be at all surprising to learn that Germany has an awful record on road safety, except that it doesn't.( 在这种情况下，意识到德国有极糟糕的安全报告并不惊讶，尽管并不糟糕 ) Indeed, Germany's road safety record is comparable, and in some cases superior, to that of all other industrialized European countries.( 事实上，德国的道路安全报告相比其他欧洲工业国家在某些方面更好 ) So is this just luck rewarding <u>recklessness</u>?( 所以难道这是全靠运气？ ) Well, first of all, it's important to concede that speed limits do apply at <u>junctions</u> and other danger spots, such as sections under repair, and that there are even weather-related speed limits on some stretches of the autobahn (lower speed limits are used in cases of wet lanes).( 首先，不得不承认对交叉路口和某些存在安全风险的情况实行限速很重要，例如路面维修，或天气原因限速（潮湿的地面会有更低的限速） ) **To fail to point this out would be to paint a picture, rather unfairly, of speed-hungry officials putting the travelling public in <u>jeopardy</u> on roads in order to gratify their own thrill-<u>lust</u>**.( 不指出这些风险将会使得渴望速度的官员为了满足他们的快感把游客们带入危险中，这相当不公平 ) Of course, this is not the case.( 当然，事实不是这样 ) Indeed, safety considerations aside, the Germans have even imposed speed limits for other purposes, such as to reduce pollution and noise on some stretches of the autobahn, so there is no crazy speed-fuelled agenda here. ( 事实上，除了安全原因，德国人也因为其他方面实行限速政策，例如减少污染和噪音，所以，这里并没有疯狂的满速飙车 )'Mad' you may say, but the Germans actually seem to think this is safe.( 你可能会说这太疯狂了，但实际上德国人真的觉得这样很安全 )

**D**

And the statistics appear to back them up though.( 然而统计数据似乎证实了们 ) After all, the International Traffic Safety Data and Analysis Group's research indicates that there are 2.2 road-user fatalities per billion vehicle kilometres on German autobahns each year.( 在这之后，国际交通安全数据分析表明，德国每年每行驶十亿公里有2.2例死亡案例 ) Using the same statistics, 4.5 fatalities occur on United States motorways each year.( 用同样的统计条件，在美国则每年有4.5例交通死亡案例 ) In fact, when you look beyond the myth of the motorway without speed limits, where drivers regularly clock up speeds in excess of 200km/h, and uncover the more <u>sober</u> reality, you realise that the German approach might not be so <u>daft</u> as it first seemed.( 事实上，当你看透德国不限速高速的传说-司机可以超过200码的地方，你会意识到，德国人并不是你看起来的那么愚蠢 ) For a start, only 2% of all traffic regularly travels on the unrestricted stretches of motorway as, despite the vast area they cover, they are strategically located in rural areas with low traffic volume.( 首先 ,只有2%的车辆在不限速路段行驶，尽管高速公路覆盖了大量区域，但是他们战略性的将其定位在了农村的低车流量区域 ) The other 98% of vehicles on the road do in fact have their speeds very strictly regulated, and these regulations are also heavily enforced.( 其他98%的车辆在路上行驶有非常严格的速度限制，而且这些规定是强制实施的 ) Speed cameras are everywhere and the motorways are patrolled by unmarked police cars ready to pull over speed offenders and reckless drivers.( 高速上布满了测速仪，而且还有便衣巡逻经常，准备随时把超速者拦下 ) The Germans have also taken into consideration statistics which show that very few road accidents occur on motorways in low-volume traffic each year.( 德国人也考虑了统计数据，表面了在这些低车流路段，每年很少发生交通事故 ) In fact, these stretches of motorway offer up some of the safest driving conditions, statistically speaking, of all.( 事实上，统计表明这些不限速路段提供了一些最安全的驾驶条件 ) The Germans have therefore reasoned that they don't need to regulate rural motorways a great deal, and it would seem they are right.( 所以德国人有充分理由证明他们不需要在农村地区限速，这也看起来是对的 )

**E**

Furthermore, the myth of limitless speed is also quite <u>misleading</u>.( 除此之外，德国不限速高速的传说也相当误导人 ) **In reality, all German car manufacturers (and most international ones) keep to a gentlemen's agreement whereby they limit the top speed of their cars to around 150 km/h for safety reasons as, unless <u>tyre</u> pressure is <u>optimally</u> maintained and cars are constantly serviced (as would happen, say, in motor racing), travelling at higher speeds than that is, well, extremely risky and can lead to <u>blowouts</u> and other physical and mechanical failures that have the potential to cause death.**( 事实上，为了安全原因，德国的造车厂商们都会将出产的车辆限制最高速度为150km/h，这是一个潜规则，除非轮胎压力和车体保持长期维护，否则高速行驶将是一个极大的风险，而且会造成死亡 ) Therefore, the situation is a little different than we might have assumed because while there is no official speed limit in theory, car manufacturers self-regulate so, in practice, a limit on the maximum speed vehicles can travel at has been put in place. In addition, the few vehicles which are capable of clocking speeds in excess of 150km/h seldom get the opportunity (the time and space) to build up to these speeds on the German autobahns, and, if they do, well, **the way the German government sees it, they might as well be driving that fast there rather than in the suburbs, so let them do it!**( 所以，情况并不是我们一开始认为的那样，虽然德国理论上没有速度限制，但是其实这早已被造车厂限制了，少部分车辆可以超出150km/h的速度限制的车辆很少有在高速公路上飙车的机会，但是如果他们这样做了，德国政府认为，他们在高速上开这么快总比在郊区开这么快好，所以让他们这样做吧！ )
